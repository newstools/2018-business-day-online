The Akwa Ibom State government has denied that it has given out the Oron marine terminal for concession, saying any report to that effect is false and without any foundation. Charles Udoh, commissioner for information and strategy, who stated this, said the state government “is in no way committed or indebted to any company over any concession agreement.” According to him, allegations that some officials of the state government were involved in deal to concede the terminal to any company for N184 million “ is a desperate attempt to tarnish the image of the state government in a bid to circumvent due process and unduly influence the legal process.’’ He said Rock Marine services approached the state government for concession of the marine terminal at Oron, but was unable to show adequate proof of ability to embark on a project of such magnitude including proof-of-funds and evidence of competence and technical partnership. The commissioner said the state government has petitioned the Economic and Financial Commission (EFCC) for a thorough investigation. It however, reaffirms its commitment to ensuring that Akwa Ibom State remains a safe haven for Foreign Direct Investment and genuine investors. Rock Marines Services had alleged it was swindled by four top officials of the state government to the tune of over N184million under the false pretence of giving concession for the Marine Terminal at Oron. It was also gathered that the state government turned down a request by the company for a Memorandum of Understanding over the Oron terminal.  ANIEFIOK UDONQUAK, Uyo
