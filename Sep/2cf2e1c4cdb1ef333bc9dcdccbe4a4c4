The main opposition People’s Democratic Party (PDP) and the Action Democratic Party (ADP) have alleged plot by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and security agencies in the country to rig Saturday’s gubernatorial election in Osun State in favour of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). The two opposition parties in separate interactions with BusinessDay Wednesday, said that they had evidence that the State government was working with some INEC officials to undermine the result of the election. Southwest vice chairman of the PDP, Eddy Olafeso, in an interview with this medium, alleged that the party had receive report of plans by the APC to collude with security officials in the State to bribe INEC officials with large sums of money, so they could write the result of the election irrespective of the performance of other parties in favour of the APC. Olafeso said that the APC resorted to this plan when it was obvious that the party would lose the election because they had performed poorly in the State since the advent of the incumbent, Rauf Aregbesola’s administration. “Everybody know the APC have done poorly here in the last eight years, how can they expect to win election here” Olafeso said. Also the ADP in a statement, signed by Kayode Agbaje, Director of Media and Publicity of the Moshood Adeoti Campaign Organization, said it doubted if the gubernatorial election would be free and fair, stressing that the party was aware of moves to rig the election in favour of APC by INEC.
