Comrade Orogwu Sunday and other leaders of Umuekumenyi Youth Assembly in a press conference in Abakaliki on Thursday declared  pointedly they were vehemently rejecting the purported automatic tickets allegedly issued to the Senator representing Ebonyi North Senatorial zone and former governor of the state ,Dr.Sam Egwu and his counterpart in Ebonyi Central senatorial zone, Senator Obinna Ogba by governor David Umahi-led Peoples Democratic Party(PDP)  in the state. The youths said the decision became imperative in order to save the party from an imminent colossal defeat in the 2019 general elections. “In Ebonyi North zone ,we abhor the issue of automatic ticket to his Excellency Senator Sam O.Egwu and also that of Senator Obinna Ogba from Ebonyi Central zone respectively. These duo have not performed well at all. We therefore  reject and condemn the purported automatic tickets given to them ” “As the youths and representatives of our people ,we shall continue to resist any attempt to render our people politically impotent .We call on the national leadership of the party to hold the proponents of the so called automatic tickets responsible for the imminent defeat of PDP in Ebonyi state in 2019″ The youths said. They however commended governor David Umahi for allegedly withdrawing the automatic  tickets issued to the member representing Ohaozara,Onicha/Ivo Federal Constituency, Linus Abaa Okorie and his counterpart in Ezza South/Ikwo federal Constituency, Laz Ogbee, saying ‘it is a true display of a good Democratic governance and sense of responsibility on the part of the governor”  and advised him to extend the same gesture to all the federal Constituencies in Abakaliki bloc.
