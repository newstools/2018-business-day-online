North and South Korea have agreed to jointly bid to host the 2032 Summer Olympic Games, both countries leaders – Kim Jong Un and Moon Jae-in – said in a shared statement on Wednesday. The leaders gave no details of which cities might host certain events at the Games, or of how advanced the plans were. The statement also mentioned that they had agreed to “participate jointly” at international competitions, including the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo. Traditionally, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) does not announce host cities until seven years ahead of the Games. This gives the two Koreas until 2025 to put together a bid. The idea of a joint bid for the 2032 Games was first mentioned last week by Seoul’s Sports Minister Do Jong-hwan. If the two nations effectively bid for the Olympics, it could bring the Summer Games to the Korean Peninsula for the first time since 1988, when Seoul was host. Germany, Australia and India have also announced their interest in hosting the 2032 Olympics.
