A car parked at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport Lagos suddenly went up in flames Saturday evening creating panic within the airport community and causing severe traffic gridlock for commuters trying to gain access into the airport. An eyewitness said that the car was parked at the open car park located opposite the Catholic Church and the Mosque and that airport authorities were battling to put off the fire.
“There has been a severe gridlock into and out of the airport at the moment as the traffic appears to be extending to Oshodi at the moment,” the source said. “When the incident happened, there was no fire fighters to quickly put off the fire. As I am speaking, efforts are being made to bring in fire fighters; but they are yet to arrive,” the source added.  Ifeoma Okeke
