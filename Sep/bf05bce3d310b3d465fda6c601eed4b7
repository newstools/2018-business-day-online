The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has accused the Police of acting the script of the All Progressives Congress (APC) against its governorship candidate in the September 22, Osun State governorship election, Ademola Adeleke. The main opposition party was reacting to Police invitation of Adeleke and filing of fresh charges against him over examination malpractice, criminal conspiracy, impersonation, breach of duty and aiding and abetting. In a statement by PDP National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbodiyan, on Wednesday, the party describes the latest twist in the Adeleke Certificate Circus, leading to laughable trumped-up charges by the Police, as horrible, nauseating and displeasing. The party says the sudden realisation of allegations that Adeleke was involved in a National Examination Council (NECO) exam malpractice in 2017, as well as his subsequent invitation by the police, barely two days before the governorship election, is a ploy by the APC to distract the PDP candidate and if possible, put him out of circulation before and during the election. “While the PDP is in no way against any legitimate effort by any security agency in the discharge of its duties, we totally reject this unrelenting attempt to use trumped up charges to take down our candidate, simply because the APC has realized that he is coasting to victory. “Perhaps, the police needs to be educated that the West African Examination Council (WAEC) has already confirmed that Senator Adeleke wrote his WAEC examination in 1981, thus ending the earlier unnecessary controversy about his WAEC status. “Moreover, this is the same police that have not been able to invite the disgraced erstwhile minister of finance, Kemi Adeosun, who confessed to having a forged NYSC Exemption Certificate or the Special Assistant to the President on Prosecution and Chairman of the Special Investigative Panel for the Recovery of Public Property, Chief Okoi Obono-Obla, whose certificate, WAEC openly told the National Assembly, is fake. “More so, there are several leaders in APC, whose certificates have been questioned and which the Police have not considered it needful to conduct the littlest investigation,” the statement reads. The party therefore calls on the Inspector General of Police, Ibrahim Idris to protect the integrity of the Force by immediately calling his officers to order.  OWEDE AGBAJILEKE, Abuja
