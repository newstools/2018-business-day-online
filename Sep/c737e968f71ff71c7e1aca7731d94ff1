Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) has hinted that Nigeria public Universities are short of not less than 40,000 lecturers. The union however called on Federal Government to recruit academic staff in public federal institutions in order to safe overworked lecturer’s from untimely death. In a release signed by Deji Omole, chairman, University of Ibadan Chapter of the Union, called for comprehensive medical check-up by various institutions to ascertain the health conditions of their staff noting that in the struggle for survival, many lecturers who think they are well may have death threatening health conditions. He disclosed that the health of their members are fast depreciating due to work overload occasioned by the failure of the federal government to employ more academics to cope with the number of students admitted. He said that while academic staff continues to work in the most dehumanised conditions, the federal government has refused to pay them their academic allowances from 2011 to date. Omole observed that due to poor working environment, job overload and non-approval of leave as and when due, the union has lost some of its members to death across the nation in 2018. The ASUU boss noted that due to work-related stress and the bad economic fortunes, lecturers hardly have time to attend to their health, and this creates health complications, which ultimately leads to incapacitation and sometimes death. He further noted that the “federal government is not only determined to kill the lecturers with stress, but also determined to kill University of Ibadan in particular.  This is being done by deliberately refusal to payroll newly recruited lecturers to replace dead or retired colleagues even when due processes were followed in the recruitment procedures”.
