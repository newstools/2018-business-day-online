President Muhammadu Buhari has delegated authority to the Director General of the National Emergency Management Agency, NEMA, Mustapha Maihaja, to declare a “national disaster’’ in the event that anticipated flooding turns a reality in parts of the country. This was contained in a statement issued by the Senior Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu. The directives, BusinessDay gathered, is not unconnected with impending floodings along the river banks, following rising volume of waters in the nation’s major rivers The rising water levels had forced warnings by the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency that Rivers Benue and Niger had almost reached levels that resulted in the similar flooding witnessed in 2012, which led to lost of lives and destruction of properties estimated at over N2 trillion. Following the early warnings, residents along the river banks have been asked to relocate from those areas as part of measures to avoid vloss of lives and minimize destruction of valuable properties. A letter to the Director of General of NEMA titled: “Situation Report on the River Flood Along the Banks of Rivers Benue and Niger’’, which was signed by the Chief of Staff to the President, Abba Kyari, said: “Delegation of authority to the Director General of NEMA to activate the Disaster Response Units of the military for possible search and rescue missions, and “The procurement and proportionate stocking of relief materials and health related items up to N3billion to provide for the needs of possible victims.’’ The letter also instructed the head of the emergency agency to “provide regular updates to the President” It will be recalled that the 2012 flood had killed about 363 people and displaced over 2.1 million people as of 5 November 2012. National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), records shows that about 30 of Nigeria’s 36 states were affected by the floods, described as the worst in 40 years. Tony Ailemen, Abuja
