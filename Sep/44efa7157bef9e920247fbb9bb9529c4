I usually watch the AMVCA’s from home. I must confess I do enjoy it because it’s live and I do not miss out on anything but after getting my invite followed by calls, I knew I had to attend so I did. It was a tedious one because the traffic was really bad. Thank goodness I didn’t drive. Getting there, it was obvious everyone came prepared.  Gorgeous guests looking stunning in their own way and the hall was packed full. It was the 1st of September 2018, the much anticipated 6th edition of the prestigious Africa Magic Viewers’ Choice Awards (AMVCAs) held to much fanfare, glitz and glam at the Eko Hotel and Suites in Lagos. The hall was filled with the crème de la crème of the African film, TV and entertainment industry and it was hosted by the returning duo of IK Osakioduwa and Minnie Dlamini. Performances included the critically acclaimed Niger-Delta dance troupe, Seki, renditions by singer-producer Cobhams Asuquo, and Nigerian opera singer, Omo Bello who performed together with her orchestra. Nigerian rapper Falz also thrilled on the night and also won the ‘Best Supporting Actor in a Drama’ award. Another highlight of the night was when renowned Nigerian cinematographer Tunde Kelani was presented with the Industry Merit award, a decision that was well received by the audience as evidenced by a prolonged standing ovation. In the same vein, the Trailblazer Award was given to Bisola Aiyeola in recognition of her growing impact in the African film and TV space. The crowning of the night was the announcement of Phoebe Ruguru’s ’18 Hours’ as the Best Overall movie, a fitting tribute to an event that featured many other Kenyan winners.  Kemi Ajumobi
