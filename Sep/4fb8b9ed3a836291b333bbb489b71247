The management of Harrysong has said they are dealing with the issues relating to the crisis the singer is facing at the moment. Few days ago, the popular singer caused quite a scare when he posted what seemed like a suicide note on his instagram handle. In the post, Harrysong had said, “Don’t cry when I die, celebrate, put up a kingmaker concert, empower more youths… I have Lived… I have done my bit. Carry on in grace… TEKERO I LOVE YOU ALL.#altersoldier.” In a chat with Bliss on the phone, Desmond Ike, who is the singer’s manager, said we the management is on top of the situation and everything would be okay soon. “Harrysong got heartbroken over some things that happened to him in the last few days but he has decided not to make it public. He is a very emotional person and most people don’t even know this side of him. No matter how strong a person is, there is always a breaking point. Before everything would get to that final point of depression, it has to be taken care of. You have to take care of the person before he slips into depression. That is what we are doing at the moment. He will be okay. We are dealing with the situation just to make sure it doesn’t get to a terrible point. “Depression is real and it is good to show love to people who are depressed. It is not good for friends to betray friends. He is having some personal challenges and he is dealing with it. When somebody gets to the point of wanting to commit suicide, that means the person needs help and that help is what we intend to give. He needs our love and our prayers. He will be very fine.
