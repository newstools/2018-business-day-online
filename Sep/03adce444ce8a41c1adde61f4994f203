Pirelli, Formula 1’s sole tyre supplier, has announced the tyre choices the different teams have made for the Singapore Grand Prix. During the race weekend at Marina Bay, which will partially take place under artificial lighting, the teams have the soft, ultra-soft and hyper-soft compound tyres at their disposal. Leaving the super-softs at home, Pirelli creates, as we have seen previously during this season, a greater difference between the different compounds. Remarkable is the rather reserved strategy of Mercedes. Lewis Hamilton and Valtteri Bottas are only bringing along six sets of the hyper-softs with them, the least of everyone. As oppose to Ferrari, together with Haas they have gone for nine sets of the softest compound. Max Verstappen and Daniel Ricciardo both opt for three sets of softs, three sets of ultra-softs and seven of the hyper-softs to run on the 5,065 km long street circuit. Sometimes even within a team the choices drivers make can be different, but this time round it has remained almost identical. Except for the Williams’, Haas’ and Sauber drivers, they have gone for a different strategy. The difference here lies in the choice of the amount of soft and ultra-soft compound tyre.
