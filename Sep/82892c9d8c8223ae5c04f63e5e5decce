Among all airports in Nigeria, Abuja airport recorded the highest number of aircraft traffic of 32,011 in the first half of 2018 as airlines dump Lagos for Abuja as passage volume increase. This figure is slightly higher than the Lagos airport which recorded aircraft traffic of 31,037. In Q1 2018, aircraft movement at Abuja airport was 16,402 which exceeded that of aircraft movement in Lagos which was 15,866. Â It maintained the marginal dominance over Lagos airport in the second quarter of 2018 that is, 15,609 at Abuja compared with 15,171 at Lagos. This increase in the dominance of Abuja airport for aircraft movement contrasts with the sharp decline in aircraft movement recorded at Lagos airports in the first two quarters of the year. Although Lagos recorded a substantial growth in a total number of air passengers in Q1 2018, the number of aircraft dropped to 15,866 in the same period, a 30.84 percent decline from the 22,939 aircraft recorded in Q4 2017. The top five airports in Nigeria in terms of the number of passengers who passed through in the first half of 2018 were Lagos, Abuja, Port Harcourt, Kano, and Owerri. These five airports served over 89.39 percent of total passengers which is 6.7 million in number in the first two quarters of 2018. The first two quarters of 2018 saw mixed performance in the various items that make up airport transportation in Nigeria. The total number of passengers who passed through Nigerian airports reached 3.8 million in the first quarter of 2018 which is a 33.51 percent growth yoy from the same quarter of 2017 and 3.7 million in the second quarter of 2018, a smaller yoy growth of 15.24 percent from the same quarter in 2017. Consequently, there was 4.9 percent decline in passengers for Q2 2018 when compared to the preceding quarter. Total aircraft traffic declined yoy for both Q1 (1.48 percent) & Q2 (10.17 percent) when compared to the corresponding quarter in 2017. In the first half of 2018, aircraft traffic totaled 96,659, a 5.9 percent decline from total aircraft recorded in the same period last year. In total, 7.5 million passengers passed through Nigerian airports in the first half of 2018, this is a 23.9 percent growth from the 6.1 million passengers recorded in the first half of 2017. This significant growth in both the first and second quarters of 2018 was mainly driven by the increased passenger traffic through Abuja airports, compared with the same period in 2017 when the Abuja airport was closed during the period for runway improvements. There was also a boost in passenger traffic in March 2018 when total air passenger was recorded at 1,721,224 (797,608 arrivals and 923,616 departures), a 62 percent leap from the average passenger traffic from the previous two months (January & February 2018). The total number of air passengers declined in the second quarter of 2018 from the first quarter by 4.90 percent standing at 3.7 million. Nevertheless, the recorded total passenger in Q2 indicates a robust yoy growth of 15.24 percent from the same quarter in 2017.
