Presidency on Wednesday said Minister of State Zainab Ahmed has officially “relinquished her position as Minister of State, Budget and National Planning” to take over her new position as Supervising Minister of State for Finance. Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, who disclosed this, during a question and answer session while briefing journalists after FEC meeting, said the clarification became necessary following the confusion over her current status. The clarification became necessary following her re-assignment to the Ministry of Finance as a result of the recent resignation of the former Minister of Finance, Kemi Adeosun, over National Youth Service Corps NYSC, certificate forgery. According to Adesina, Zainab who was minister of state budget and national planning, will relinquish that or she has relinquished that to go and oversee the finance ministry, so that is her status for now” “ It is a matter of nomenclature, yes but she is overseeing the ministry” “What you call her is a matter of nomenclature but if she is overseeing the ministry, then she is. But note that she is no longer minister of state budget and national planning for now until anything contrary happens. But for now, she is in charge of the ministry of finance. Adesina affirmed that Zainab who was at the meeting of the Federal Executive Council and actually sat on the Minister of Finance seat, was now being addressed as “ Minister of Finance” “ I just told you she is no longer minister of state budget and national planning. In fact that was how she was addressed at council. Don’t forget it is also a legal thing, if a minister is going to be appointed there are procedures that is why it is a deployment.”  Tony Ailemen, Abuja
