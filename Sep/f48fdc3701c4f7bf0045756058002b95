Actress Chioma Akpotha paid back one of her fans in his own coins when the guy decided to cyber bully on social media few days ago. The actress, who just came back from Dubai where she went for a vacation with her friends and colleagues including Ufoma McDermott, Uche Jombo and Omoni Oboli, posted a short video of herself on her instagram handle. The video attracted so many likes and positive comments but one of her fans wasn’t in the mood to join the bandwagon. The fan with the handle, osigweikenna, posted in the comment section, “U don old, so stop this things, I have ask u, what investments do u have in IMO State @chiomakpotha?” Notwithstanding the other numerous comments, Chioma singled this comment aside and gave it back to the fan. In her response, Chioma said, “First, it is ‘these’ and not this. Second, it is ‘asked’ and not ask. Finally, ibu ezigbote anumanu (You are a real animal)”. Her comment also attracted likes as her fans joined her to attack @osigweikenna. With the handle, iamthenny, one of her fans said, “@osigweikenna If y our life is bitter please leave @chiomakpotha alone to enjoy her life and stop asking silly questions about her investments.” Another fan also said, “@osigweikenna this is what you get when you bring out your unrefined self in public. Yawa ‘gasted’ upon you! For me it’s not about being a celeb but about leaving people alone to enjoy relative peace on their page. Comment no be by force!”
