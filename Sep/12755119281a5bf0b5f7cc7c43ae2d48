When Matthew Seiyefa took over as the Acting Director General DG , Department of State Security Service, ( DSS) many had feared that his reign was going to be short because of the activities of the Cabals at the Presidency. BusinessDay gathered on Sunday, that already the Chief of Staff to the President Abba Kyari who is not pleased with the administrative actions taken by the acting DG, so far, has “ ordered” reversal of the actions. There are also indications that there are behind the scene moves to bring back the former DG, DSS, Lawal Daura, who has been fighting to reclaim his position. The acting DG was said to have redeployed some of the staff including the Director of DSS in Kano, Alhassan Muhammad to the Headquarters in Abuja, while Godwin Etang, Director Operations at the Headquarters, was moved to the Institute of Security Studies, Abuja as Director. Our source revealed that over 30 staff of the security outfit has been affected by the recent reorganization which were carried out “ to strengthen our agency” Our resource revealed that was deployed to Abuja office as the Chief of Staff to the DG in Abuja. BusinessDay gathered that despite the fact that all the administrative actions received the backing of the National Security Adviser to the President, Babagan Mongonu, to whom the acting DG report directly, the Chief of Staff to the President wrote to the acting DG to reverse the action. BusinessDay gathered that the action of theChief of Staff to the President is causing disaffection, even as the acting DG DSS has insisted he will only take instructions from the NSA BusinessDay gathered that the Chief of Staff “ Order” is to allow the status quo which Daura left, in a move that is likely to pave the way for his likely return It is believed that many of those who worked with Daura as helmsman of the President’s secrete police are not happy considerate Seiyefa’s ethic extraction This, coupled with the proven unfavourable sectional and nepotic appointment of the heads of security formations by the President Buhari himself, made Seiyefa’s emergence looks like an aberration from the norms. The new Head of Public Relations at the DSS, Peter Afunanya could not be reached for comments as he was said to be presently out of the country. This is just as it was difficult to get Presidency reactions on Sunday as the President’s Media aides are also away in China, accompanying the President.  Anthony Ailemen
