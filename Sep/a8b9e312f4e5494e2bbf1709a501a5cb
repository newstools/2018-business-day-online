A group of indigenes from Ifon town, headquarters of Orolu Local Government Area of Osun State, called ‘Orolu Concerned Patriots’, on Wednesday said many indigenes of the town, have been chased out of their homes, allegedly by suspected hoodlums working for the All Progressives Congress (APC). It would be recalled that rerun election was ordered in Ifon ward 8 and 9, alongside four others in Osogbo Local Government, Ife North and Ife South Local Government Areas of Osun State by INEC after the September 22 governorship poll was declared inconclusive. Addressing newsmen at NUJ Press Centre, Osogbo, coordinator of the group, Adelaja Akinyooye, said political thugs, who have been allegedly deployed for the poll by one of the parties have taken over streets in the town with the intent to attack every known member of their opposition. Akinyooye said: “The residence of Ashifat Okikiola Olarinde, our community leader and frontline PDP pillar was attacked and a lot of people were harassed for no reason by political thugs. They later took to the street to shoot sporadically and pursue every identified PDP members. “We would like to seize this opportunity to alert the public that some greedy politicians have strategically recruited some fake soldiers to disrupt governorship rerun poll in Orolu Local Government with a view to suppressing people’s wish. Therefore, we are calling on Chief of Army Staff and Inspector General of Police to rise up to the situation. “It is unfortunate that some eminent community and political personalities have been marked for elimination for no fair reason and calling on the National Assembly and the Presidency to rise up and save our soul”.
