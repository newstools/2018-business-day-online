One of the aides to the incumbent Kano Governor, Abdullahi Ganduje, confirmed “H.E Mallam Ibrahim Shekarau former Governor of Kano State has picked up the Senate Nomination Form for Kano Central Zone under the APC today”. “He will be replacing the former Gov of Kano and soon to be one term Senator, Kwankwaso in the forthcoming 2019 elections.”. BusinessDay gathered that Shekarau had been in contact with vice president Yemi Osinbajo since the gale of defection struck across both ruling and opposition party. Inside sources said the ruling party had made a number of promises to  Shekarau, including a ministerial slot, should he dump the PDP and join APC. While vice president started the overture, the governor of Kano State Abdullahi Ganduje struck a deal with him on the eve of his ‘defection’. Sources familiar with the meeting said Ibrahim Shekarau demanded a senatorial slot (for himself) and deputy governor position (to nominate one of his associates) from Abdullahi Ganduje. DAILY NIGERIAN reliably gathered that Iibrahim Shekarau is pushing for the appointment of Umar Maimansaleta as deputy governor, but Abdullahi Ganduje is not keen on the idea. “You know Shekarau is critical to our success at the poll and we want to do whatever possible to retain him. Much as Ganduje wants Shekarau in the APC, he doesn’t not want to appoint a deputy whose total loyalty will be to someone not him. “Ganduje simply doesn’t want a repeat of Professor Hafizu case. So he is more inclined to appointing somebody with grassroots support from his camp. “Ganduje may accept to take Maimansaleta as deputy but it is just a mere Greek gift,” said a source who preferred anonymity. According to the source, Abdullahi Ganduje may set a booby trap for Shekarau by accepting the offer of  Maimansaleta as deputy, but plot his rejection at the Kano State House of Assembly.
