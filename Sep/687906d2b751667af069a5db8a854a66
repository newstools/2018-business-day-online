Ahead of Saturday’s All Progressives Congress’ (APC) governorship primary election, the posters of the two major contestants have flooded the state. Although three aspirants: Ambode, Sanwo-Olu and Babafemi Hamzat are seeking to fly the party’s flag the 2019 elections, the contest is seen narrowing down to the first two. The third aspirant, Hamzat had been silent, and seen doing nothing to suggest seriousness since picking up his nomination forms three weeks ago.
This fueled speculation he may withdrawn from the contest. Posters of Ambode and his rival are seen on walls, pedestrian bridges as well as walls by the road sides especially at Agege Motor Way, Ikeja and all 20 Local governments and 37 Local council development areas of the state. Sanwoolu’s posters are seen in Ikeja Maryland, Anthony area, with inscriptions with APC logo read: Lagos 2019, Support Jide Sanwoolu for Lagos State Governor. Igbega Ipinle Eko, Ajumose ni.” Also, Ambode posters have been seen in Badagry with the inscription “I Stand With Ambode”, “Re Elect Gov. Ambode 2019” said to have been sponsored by various groups and volunteers, under the Itesiwaju Ipinle Eko Vanguard. The coordinator of the group, Seyi Bamigbade told journalists that, Ambode was a brand for the APC to win the governorship election in 2019. He said the governor’s achievements so far have been dedicated to the Lagos electorate. “Ambode has proved that he can rule the Lagos megacity statues with trust“. He urged party faithful to come out and vote Governor Akinwunmi Ambode on that day of the election peacefully in all the 20 local governments and 245 wards where the election will take place.
