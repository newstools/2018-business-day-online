Tiger Woods is skipping a pre-tournament pro-am on Wednesday at the BMW Championship. There is no visible injury issue, as Tiger Woods was at Aronimink Golf Club on Tuesday for a nine-hole practice round with Rory McIlroy. It’s the first time Tiger Woods is not taking part in a tournament’s official Pro-Am this season. The highest-ranked players in the field at events that hold official pro-ams are typically required to participate in order to compete in the tournament proper, but golfers can apply for the occasional waiver. Woods stepping back at Aronimink comes after he declined to speak with the media following his closing 71 to finish T-24 in the Dell Technologies Championship. He also is not listed among players scheduled for pre-tournament press conferences ahead of the BMW. The one consistent concern Tiger Woods has voiced as he’s played his way through his 2018 comeback season has been getting the proper recovery time between starts. “I’m 42 now, and I’ve had four back surgeries. So things are going to be different from day-to-day, and it’s just about managing it,” Tiger Woods said prior to last month’s PGA Championship, where he arrived a day later than he typically does for a major championship and talked about the regime of ice baths he had taken after. “I didn’t really have any of those issues early in my career because I didn’t have a fixed point in my back. My knee used to hurt a lot, but I could play around that. Playing around my spine’s a little bit different.” Tiger Woods in the midst of playing five tour events in a six-week span, by far the most competitive golf he has played since his last full season in 2013. With a solid finish this week at Aronimink, Woods can qualify for the Tour Championship in two weeks and should he be a captain’s pick for the U.S. Ryder Cup team. That would extend his play to seven events in nine weeks.
