The Action Democratic Congress (ADP) has expressed dismay over Tuesday’s raid on the Abuja residence of former Federal Commissioner for Information and Niger Delta leader, Edwin Clark, by three police officers of the rank of Inspectors, who were led by an Assistant Superintendent of the Police (ASP) over suspicion of arms stockpile, which turned out to be false. A statement signed by the National Chairman of ADP, Yusuf Sani Yabagi, said although the party appreciate the fact that the Inspector General of Police, Ibrahim Idris, has tendered unreserved apology to the 91- year- old Clark, ordered the dismissal of the three inspectors and put the ASP under interdiction, pending his imminent dismissal, the party is disturbed that the police could deny the Tactical Squad from the Office of the IGP, which carried out such raid with a search warrant allegedly obtained from a court. “The police spokesman Jimoh Moshood while trying to absolve the IGP of any blames, said the indicted officers action was “unauthorized, illegal and unprofessional” but with regards to the circumstances of the invasion and uncivilized search conducted on Clark’s house and the attendant embarrassment the elder statesman suffered, it raises fundamental questions about the command and control system of the police. “If police officers can carry out unauthorized and brazen raid on the house of a prominent figure like Clark based on unsubstantiated information provided by one Ismail Yakubu, who the police said is now facing prosecution for misleading them, then it speaks volume as to how rogue elements within the force have rendered our country and lives unsafe,” Yabagi said. The statement further quoted Clark’s lawyer, Kayode Ajulo, as saying that the Ijaw leader had confirmed that the officers and men of the IGP Tactical Squad commenced their search having introduced themselves, stating that they were acting under the instructions of the Inspector General of Police and Deputy Commissioner of Police Yusuf Kolo as their commander. Kayode said further that Ambassador Boladei Igali (Former SSG Bayelsa State and former Permanent Secretary Ministry of Power) who was with Clark at the venue of the search put a call through to Assistant Inspector General of Police (Federal Intelligence) Umoru Usman Shehu who spoke with the leader of the search party and gave authority to go ahead with the search. “So, it is baffling to us that the top echelon of the Nigeria Police Force will publicly claim they did not authorize the invasion despite the fact that clear contacts were made with them before the search commenced. “We suspect a conspiracy against the IGP himself by his men or an attempt by the police to cover up what appears to be a failed vendetta mission on the elder statesman while making the hapless officers the fall guys of the botched attempt to hound the Niger Delta leader, following his ceaseless political activities on restructuring which elements within the government are unhappy with,” the statement said. The ADP lamented that there are several cases of this ugly development of unauthorized raid and violence against hapless Nigerians, stressing that the public only heard about this particular case only because Clark is a prominent politician. “We therefore demand a thorough multi-agency investigation into the matter and the outcome made public within the shortest possible time to unravel the circumstances surrounding this national embarrassment,” the party said.
