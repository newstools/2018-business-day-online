Governor Aminu Masari of Katsina state, Thursday said the state is one hundred percent fully behind President Muhammadu Buhari’s 2019 re-election bid, adding that it is ready to give him 2.5million votes. Masari who stated this at the Presidential Villa, after a meeting with the President, boasted that “based on  figures coming out of the registered voters to give him nothing less than 70 to 80%.” “We don’t have the figures now because they have just completed additional registration, we are not talking about the last exercise that led to the election of 2015 and in 2015 he got almost 1.5 million votes from Katsina state , so we expect by 2019 we will be able to give him additional 1 million making it not less than 2.5 million votes”  he said Masari, while also speaking on the proposed direct primaries by the All Progressive Congress (APC), said the party’s constitution already recognizes “ direct primaries” wondering the reasons for the current controversies on the issue. “ It is not a hot cake .first of all, let me say from all the states that we have read and heard, Lagos, Kano and Niger are the only states that have opted for direct primaries in  a country of 36 states plus FCT. “ I think it shouldn’t be contentious issue. Infact the constitution of the party is very clear,  there is nothing contentious in this . “The constitution of the party recognises direct, consensus and indirect primaries,  so which ever method is adopted, nobody is breaching the constitution of the party so what is the big deal about it The Katsina Governor also applauded decision by the Federal Executive Council (FEC) to set up electoral offence commission and a tribunal that will try electoral offenders He assured that “ the tribunal will help in sanitising the electoral process” adding that the “ legal system as at today is prolonged and takes time and cases are decided when you have even forgotten about your offence and I think , this will help to sanitise and make the elections more credible . “If I could remember during the Uwais committee,  we were heading some  sub comitttees of former legislators , former and serving governors and we made presentation and part of our recommendations is that apart from the independence of the electoral body, we should also establish this tribunal” he said
