Former chairman of the main opposition People’s Democratic Party (PDP) in Lagos State, Moshood Salvador, has said that the party was dead in the State. Salvador spoke to newsmen in his resident in Surulere ahead of his official defection to the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). He accused leaders of the party in Lagos of not being interested in winning elections, stressing that he was leaving the PDP with the majority of its leaders in the State. He urged leaders of the party in the State to accept its defeat in the 2019 general elections, stressing that he would mobilize his resources for the victory of the APC across the South-western States. “PDP is dead in Lagos, I can tell you that, I am leaving the party tomorrow with most of it leaders across the State. They should accept their defect in the 2019 elections; they are unserious people, I would work and mobilised my resources for the victory of the APC in next year’s elections. “I cannot continue to be in a party where the leaders are not serious, it‘s like continuing to pour water in baskets,” Salvador said.
