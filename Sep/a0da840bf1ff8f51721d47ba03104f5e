The Department of Security Service (DSS) has taken over the alleged case of fraud involving one Baba Inna, the Aide De Camp to the Wife of the President, Aisha Buhari, who allegedly made away with N2.5 billion belonging to her. Spokesman of the secret police, Peter Afunanya, on Tuesday confirmed that the police had handed over the case to the DSS, and the suspect is under detention, adding that investigation is ongoing to unravel the circumstances surrounding fraud of N2.5 billion said to be money donated to Aisha for her pet projects. Aisha was said to have been furious with the police over what she claimed was a conspiracy to cover of the alleged fraud of Inna by the police authorities, who earlier investigated the matter and reported that they found nothing incriminating with Inna, who is a police officer. Aisha alleged that Baba-Inna received huge donations from politicians, businessmen, and women on her behalf but did not hand the money over to her. According to a source, the police had earlier reported that when they searched the house of Inna, they found only N1, 200 cash in his house and could only find N30, 000 in his bank account. However, the DSS investigative team has reportedly requested for the bank account of the police officer and that of his wife.  Innocent Odoh, Abuja
