Delta State Government warned that soon it would clampdown on defaulters of Ground Rent on Land and Properties as from 2011 till date. It also said that all those who had made payment were expected to proceed to the Ground Rent Desk at the Ministry of Lands and Surveys, Ibusa Road, Asaba or the Circle Office at the Ministry of Lands and Surveys, Warri-Sapele Road, by Enerhen Junction, Warri with proof of payment for acknowledgment purposes to avoid being sanctioned. Private and corporate land owners were advised to visit the Ground Desk Rent at the Deeds Registry of the Ministry of Lands and Surveys, Asaba or contact the Regional Circle offices to pick up their Demand Notices to enable them clear their outstanding Ground Rent. All private or corporate land owners across the State that fall within the stated period, are advised to go and pay to the relevant banks, Osahon advised.
