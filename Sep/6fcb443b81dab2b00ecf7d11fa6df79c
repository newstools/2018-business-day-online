The United Nations Development Program (UNDP) has disclosed that over 1 million Nigerians are under slavery as trafficking in persons remains unabated despite the country’s huge oil receipts. Maria Grazia Giammarinaro, United Nations Special Rapporteur, speaking at the press briefing in Abuja on Monday said that despite Nigeria being the largest oil producer and ranks sixth in the world, with 2.5 million of oil produced daily, 64 percent of its citizens still live below the poverty line and trafficking in persons remains unabated. Grazia, presenting findings from her visit to some states in Nigeria said that the fight against trafficking in Nigeria appear significantly underfunded by the Government and highly relying on
other actors, and particularly civil society organisations. She said “Nigeria remains a source, transit and destination country for victims of trafficking, I would like to highlight that the first indicator of political commitment lies in allocating adequate
resources to specialised agencies and programs dedicated to the fight against trafficking, which at present, appear significantly underfunded by the Government” “With the wealth and political leverage in Nigeria, the Government of Nigeria cannot be seen to leave its people behind, to put people at the forefront of development, it is of utmost importance to ensure that the fight against trafficking in persons, remains high on the national agenda” she added. According to her, a revived political will and a better coordination across relevant federal inter-governmental departments, as well as between NAPTIP and State’s initiatives is needed to put in place dedicated actions and holistic anti-trafficking responses Speaking on the adverse effect of trafficking, Grazia said that the victims are often subject to all forms of human rights violations such as torture, rape, extortion, and exploitation amounting to
trafficking, slavery and forced labour adding that severe forms of exploitation are also perpetrated by traffickers and final exploiters, through organised crime networks. She said Internal trafficking mainly from rural to urban areas is also rampant in Nigeria, although often overlooked, mainly affects women and girls for the purpose of domestic servitude and sexual exploitation and men and boys for the purpose of child begging, including in connection with Almajiri practice in some parts of the country. “Other forms of internal trafficking reported include the issue of so-called ‘baby factories’, namely orphanages, maternity homes or religious centres where women are held against their will, raped and forced to carry and deliver children who are sometimes sold with the intent to exploit them in sexual and labour exploitation, according to information received during the visit” she added. Grazia however commended the efforts of the National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP) both at federal and state level, as well as the recent initiative of the Governor of Edo State to put in place the ‘Edo State Task Force against Human Trafficking’ chaired by the Edo State Attorney General. “I also appreciation the work of the Edo State Task Force in receiving and welcoming returnees and assisting their reintegration into society, the role of the Nigerian government in facilitating,
including with the support of specialised UN agencies, the repatriation of many Nigerians held in slavery-like conditions from Libya, Mali and elsewhere”.  Cynthia Egboboh, Abuja.
