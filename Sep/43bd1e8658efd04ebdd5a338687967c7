The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has announced that 46 out of the 91 political parties in Nigeria have so far indicated their interest to conduct primaries for the 2019 General Elections. This is in line with the Electoral Act 2010 (Amendment) Bill which provides that all political parties must inform the Commission in writing no later than 21 days to the date of their primaries. INEC National Commissioner in charge of Publicity, Adedeji Soyebi, revealed this in Abuja on Monday at a Situation Room Dialogue Session. According to the timetable and schedule of activities released by the electoral body, political parties have between August 18 and October 7 to conclude their primaries. This comes as the Convener of Situation Room and Executive Director, Policy and Legal Advocacy Centre (PLAC), Clement Nwankwo has expressed disappointment over the inability of President Muhammadu Buhari to sign the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill into law, with about five months to the 2019 General Election. The exercise is billed for February 16 and March 2, 2019. Details laterâ€¦.  OWEDE AGBAJILEKE, Abuja
