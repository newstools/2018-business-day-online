Barely 33 days before handing over, the Ekiti state house of assembly has approved the N10 billion supplementary budget presented by the out governor of the state, Ayodele Fayose. The Budget was approved yesterday at a sitting which commenced at 12pm  with only 14 lawmakers instead of 26 and presided over by Kola Oluwawole, the speaker of the house who went through the proposal within an hour and passed it after barring members of the press from gaining entrance. On September 11, Fayose had forwarded a supplementary bill, titled ‘2018 Revised Budget’, for the sum of N9. 93 billion to the Ekiti State House of Assembly for passage.
