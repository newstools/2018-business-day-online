Kemi Adetiba surely has her way of holding us spell bound. We thought we had seen it all in her brilliant directorial piece, The Wedding Party but alas, Kemi only gave us a tip of the iceberg. From when I started hearing about the movie, I knew she was going to have us on the edge of our seats and so far, my expectations have not been dashed. She shared the poster of the movie with Sola Sobowale looking fierce and daring. Sola looked like she was saying “Bring it on” and when Kemi shared the trailer, my jaw literarily dropped. Trust me, we are surely in for the time of our lives. King of Boys follows the story of Alhaja Eniola Salami, a businesswoman and philanthropist with a checkered past and a promising political future. She is a pillar of society, loved by many, feared by most, and truly known by a select few. As her political ambitions see her outgrowing the underworld connections responsible for her considerable wealth, she’s drawn into a power struggle that threatens everything she holds dear. To come out of this on top, she will need every ounce of the cunning, ruthlessness, and strategy that took her to the top, as well as the loyalty of those closest to her. But who can she really trust? Watch out for this epic movie set to be released at the cinemas on the 26th of October!  Kemi Ajumobi
