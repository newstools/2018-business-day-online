 Her death which occurred on Friday afternoon reportedly resulted from cancer complications which she has been battling with since 2016. She was said to have been cured of the disease but suffered a relapse three months ago which led to her travelling to the United States. She had since returned to the country and recuperating in Abuja until the incident occurred today.
