Each singles champion will receive $3.8 million, the largest payout in US Open history and a $100,000 increase from last year. Similar to the past three years, the USTA is improving the payouts for the first three rounds of the tournament to drive more of the increases to the majority of the players. “2018 is a significant year in our history,” said USTA Chairman of the Board and President Katrina Adams. “Not only is it the 50th anniversary of the tournament, we also have completed the five-year transformation of the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center. We know that we are poised for incredible growth moving forward.” Prize money at the US Open has increased by 57 percent since 2013.
