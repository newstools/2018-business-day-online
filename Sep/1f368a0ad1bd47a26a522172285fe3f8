There is is steady increase in the Rivers/Bayelsa branch over the years. This is one of the progressive branches. Recession: Manufacturing sector is one of the worst-hit sectors. Many companies shut down and many others are still sick. Recession over, but challenges not over Yes, there is reduction in inflation rate and crude oil is growing both in volume and price, among some other positive indicators, but challenges are not over. There is need to rethink growth strategies for the economy. Harmony is important to boost stability and growth. We observe that Rivers manufacturing sector is growing but that of Bayelsa does not seem to. We urge states to reduce anti-manufacturing policies to attract manufacturing and grow their real sectors. MAN not againt AfFTA in principle In the past four years, we have constantly engaged heads of ministries and departments of government. For instance, MAN and other sector leaders stopped AfCFTA agreement. MAN is actually not against the pact in principle, but we are saying there was no adequate consultation or country-specific study to show what Nigeria stood to gain and lose and how to mitigate the areas of harm. Report MAN study out August end MAN has now commissioned such a study; the result will come out at the end of August 2018. We will share the report with the FG for them to decide what next to do; to sign or not to sign. They would decide, should they sign it, what measures to adopt in certain areas. Media reporting of the pact issue is not full. Many misled the nation. The concerns are being addressed. What is important is that we must continue to protect our investments. MAN is doing new membership certificates, so members have to endeavour to meet up. I must thank Rivers/Bayelsa branch for their vibrancy and their wise counsels all through my tenure. This is a very productive branch. This is my last visit as MAN president.
