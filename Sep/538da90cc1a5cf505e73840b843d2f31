Two factions of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Cross River State have adopted direct primaries to select their candidates for the 2019 general election in the state, as the crises continued to linger. The state executive committee led by Godwin Etim John dropped the hint in Calabar during a stakeholders’ meeting of the party at its secretariat. During the meeting, the party resolved to adopt the direct primaries as canvassed by the Adams Oshiohmhole National Working Committee (NWC). The stakeholders also agreed to pursue with vigour the ongoing party registration and mandated the chapter chairmen to leave no stone unturned in the exercise. Both factions have aspirants for various elective positions in the state, including governorship. “The APC Cross River State noted that as a law abiding party, that believes in the supremacy of the rule of law and our courts, resolved not to be part of any scheme to undermine the order made by a court of competent jurisdiction in the country,” it said. It would be recalled that the Mathew Achibe-led executive had last week adopted the direct primaries for the upcoming general election as directed by the NWC for states to choose between the two options in electing their candidates.
