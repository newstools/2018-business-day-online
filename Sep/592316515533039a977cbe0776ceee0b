The Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) pledged on Thursday to help Nigeria tackle the Boko Haram insurgency particularly through sound education among others. Meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari on the sidelines of the ongoing 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly in New York, OIC Secretary-General, Youssef Ahmed Al-Othaimeen said that his organisation was ready to use its facilities and institutions to correct the wrong narrative that the Boko Haram insurgency was about Islam. The OIC scribe told the Nigerian President that his organisation had passed a resolution committing member states to support Nigeria in combating extremism. Al-Othaimeen, emphasised they considered it quite essential to help Nigerian government address extremism, and would assist as much as they can. Responding during the bilateral meeting, President Buhari underscored the importance of education in purging the mind of wrong indoctrination, particularly on religion. According to him, insurgency in Nigeria was aggravated by climate change and population explosion, and there is the need to reecharge the Lake Chad through inter-basin water transfer, “to take care of about 45 million people who depend on the lake for agriculture, animal husbandry, fishing, and many others.”  Onyinye Nwachukwu, New York
