The Controller General of Prisons, Ja’afaru Ahmed has approved the dismissal of three junior officers for smuggling prohibited items into the prison for inmates. The dismissed officers whose names were given as IP Samaila Inusa, PA 11 Jonathan Ibrahim and PA 11 Adamu Jethro, were dismissed following recommendations  of the Zonal Disciplinary Committee  which found  them  guilty of  secreting illicit items such as Indian hemp (cannabis) and other intoxicants. The Public Relations Officer, Francis Enobore,in a statement said exposing inmates to these prohibited substances is capable of jeopardising security of lives and properties within the prison facility. “It should be noted that apart from fuelling indiscipline and the health harzard  on the inmates, access to cannabis and intoxicants has been implicated in a number of escapes and jailbreaks recorded in the past, thus jeopardizing security of life and property of innocent personnel and inmates including the larger society,”he said. According to Enobore,”The Controller General has resolved to ensure that proven cases of indiscipline against any personnel particularly on offences that are capable of causing security breach, are promptly meted with appropriate sanctions according to law. “While this action is to serve as deterrence to would be incorrigible individuals, the Prisons boss further warned that stiffer punishment awaits anyone found guilty of compromising standards and good conduct expected of a Correction Officer.”
