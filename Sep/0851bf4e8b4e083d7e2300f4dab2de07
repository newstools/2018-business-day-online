Beyond the normal end of year festivities, there is another reason to visit the eastern part of the country, particularly Onitsha this year. The commercial city will be hosting indigenes, friends and lovers of entertainment to 10 days of fun tagged ‘Golibe’, which literarily means to enjoy. The festival, which is expected to attract over 100,000 visitors during the last week in December, promises to thrill guests with stellar theatrical and cultural performances, music concert, art and craft, sports competitions, carnival, carol, among others. One unique offering of the festival is  a date with the paramount ruler of Onitsha at his palace. Of course, Alfred Achebe, the Obi of Onitsha, and one of the highly revered royal fathers in the country, is the chief host. He will be flagging off the festival on December 24, 2018 and awaits your visit to thrill you with the best of Igbo cultural heritage, entertainment, food and history. As well, Amalunweze Francis Anatogu, chairman of the organising  committee, urges the public to keep a date with the festival as it promises exciting offerings beyond reunion and the usual annual homecoming. “The Golibe festival will be a world-class entertainment experience for 10 days in Onitsha. Our objective is to provide the grandest entertainment in Eastern Nigeria that will be packed with everything including; music, art, culture, dance, food and fun activities for all ages,” he explained.
