Abdulrazak Namdas, chairman, House Committee on Media and Public Affairs on Sunday dismissed report on the alleged defection of Deputy Speaker, Yussuff Lasun from All Progressive Congress (APC). Namdas who disclosed this via a chat with Legislative Correspondents, argued that it was another ploy by the opposition to destabilize the ranks of the ruling in the House. Namdas, who described the report as a ‘mischief’, said: “there was nothing like. I am telling you authoritatively the Deputy Speaker did not defect, he has not defected and he will not defect. “Though I don’t know what those spreading this rumour wants to gain, but this I a mere wish that won’t come true. “The Deputy Speaker has said it severally, at different fora that he belonged here and will never contemplate leaving the party. “He is a committed man, he has been tested severally and found to be a man of his words. “Lasun is a member of APC, that, I am telling you authoritatively,” the Adamawa lawmaker said.
