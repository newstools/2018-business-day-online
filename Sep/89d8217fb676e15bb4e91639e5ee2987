There was pandemonium at the National Assembly complex and Federal Secretariat on Monday following unprecedented manoeuvering of three military war planes over the complex. Our Correspondent who witnessed the scene observed that the war planes embarked on acrobatic displays. Security agents including policemen deployed to the National Assembly rushed out of the security posts at the entrance leading to the National Assembly. According to some of the Abuja residents who spoke with our Correspondent, similar war planes were seen hovering around Kurudu area of Abuja on Sunday. Some journalists also noticed the jets at about 12.45 pm and 2.05pm on Monday when it flew so close to the ground that they had to run for cover inside their cars. However, checks by our Correspondent showed that there was no signs of any ceremony at the military arcade in front of the National Assembly Complex. Meanwhile, indications emerged on Monday that the National Assembly resumption has been postponed by two weeks. The National Assembly which was slated to resume on Tuesday, 25th September, 2018, will now reconvene on Tuesday, 9th October, 2018. According to sources privy to the workings of the National Assembly, formal notice will be issued by the office of the Clerk of the National Assembly (CNA) next week Monday.  KEHINDE AKINTOLA, Abuja
