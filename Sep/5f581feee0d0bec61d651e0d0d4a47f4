Even as pop singer, Davido, has explained why he had to cancel his US tour few days ago, so many of his fans are certainly angry with the young singer and they have expressed their feelings.
The singer, who made headlines recently when he commenced the one year compulsory National Youth Service programme for graduates, said he had to cancel his show primarily because of his NYSC engagements.
Making this announcement via his social media handle, Davido said, “Due to scheduling conflict and National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) commitments in Nigeria, the remaining dates for the Davido Locked Up Tour has been cancelled. Refunds will be made available at point of purchase. Davido and his team are working hard to reschedule all dates plus add new dates in the near future. I love you guys and see you soon. Houston, Dallas, LA and San Francisco would be giving y’all new dates soon,”
His post attracted mixed reactions even as so many people felt his announcement came a bit late.
A fan via the handle, @egolini12 said, “So you mean you didn’t know of your so called NYSC schedule before selling tickets? Rubbish. It makes no sense.”
Another fan via the handle @yuppiewho said, “Thank God I didn’t buy a ticket. It’s like I knew you would cancel. Why wait till last minute to announce? Why not days ago? I have friends who cancelled work and travelled, who will reimburse them? You artistes have to respect people, their times and lives. Your fans make you popular. And please quit the talk about NYSC. You went to camp for a few days and left to tour in America. You could have been honest and say it’s about your uncle’s campaign. You have definitely lost fans.”
And @amazinbeautee could not hide her disappointment as she posted, “I am so upset with you. Do you know how long I have been waiting on this concert and then you let us know 40 minutes before the event? That was very inconsiderate. I am really upset and I know you are in Africa.
