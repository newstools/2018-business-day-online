In a bid to ensure adequate productivity and work-life balance culture, Greenwich Trust Limited, a leading investment banking firm, held an exquisite family funfair to foster bonding amongst staff and family. Speaking at an interview with newsmen at Muri Okunola Park, Victoria Island, Lagos, Kayode Falowo, group managing director, Greenwich Trust Limited, said that the essence of the event was to appreciate members of the Greenwich family. “The family funfair is a special occasion to appreciate our families, spouses, and children. It also gives us an opportunity to interact and bond with each other in a relaxed mood. Personally, I have also been able to identify and interact with wives, husbands, and children of the Greenwich family”. Falowo said Greenwich Trust Limited was an organisation putting staff and family at heart and were always concerned about their work-life balance. He stated that this was the first time the company would be doing such an event and hoped to sustain it in the future to ensure that families knew each other, socialised and networked. The programme would increase staff productivity because a happy staff member was a productive staff, he stated. Falowo used the occasion to appreciate God for his love and kindness for Greenwich Trust Ltd. “Honestly, God has helped us achieve beyond our expectation. From a monoline of the business of 50 to 60 staff, today, we operate in various sectors such as asset management, investment banking, security brokerage, manufacturing, trustees, and registrars, among others, with over 500 staff,” he stated.
