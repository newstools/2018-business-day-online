Ebonyi State government has disclosed that it made over N3b from fix deposit accruing from all the money fixed by the State Government for the past three years. Governor David Umahi disclosed this during a stakeholders meeting with Labour and civil servants in Executive Council chambers, government House, Abakaliki where he said the state policy under his watch had made it a policy that any government money that is staying in the bank beyond 24 hours must be fixed. He said over 2.9b of one of the ranches of the Paris Club had been given to the local government staff for salary and other entitlements, adding that pension and gratuities were not paid in the state since 2006 till date. Governor Umahi lamented that past administration in the state could not give any account of the money recieved from the Paris Club refunds, saying ” we wrote the past administration to tell us how they spent the refund which made Ebonyi indebted to the tune of $500m, they didn’t reply and we decided to let the sleeping dog lie” Umahi also disclosed that UBEC counterpart funds were not paid by the previous administration, and maintained that his administration came under severe debt in the accruals from the Paris Club refunds.
