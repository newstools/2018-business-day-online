Wife of the President, Aisha Muhammadu Buhari has disassociated herself from the purported illegal detention of her Aide De Camp (ADC), Sani Baban-Inna, over allegations of fraud. This followed reports that Baban-Inna, a Chief Superintendent of Police (CSP), was detained on her orders for dropping her name and defrauding unsuspecting officials and associates. A statement Suleiman Haruna, Director of Information to Wife of the President, said the First Lady “was using the “opportunity to refute such allegation and to state that she has no hand in his arrest and detention” She however explained that Sani Baban-Inna who has been her ADC since 2016, was discovered to have been using his position to “ defraud unsuspecting associates and officials as initial investigations have shown. “The Nigeria Police Force, his employers arrested him to investigate the allegations leveled against him, this, being within their jurisdiction. She therefore wishes to use this opportunity to inform the general public that she has never sent any of her staff to collect any favours on her behalf or on behalf of her children and will never do so. She also implored anyone that has been defrauded by Baban-Inna to get across to him to retrieve whatever he took from them, adding that “she will not condone fraudulent behavior by any of her staff.” “She uses this opportunity to call on all those in positions of authority to rise above intimidation by their aides and deal with such attitudes as extortion by name-dropping, especially within the Presidency.
“As she always emphasizes, this government was voted into office based on the trust and confidence of the people”  Tony Ailemen, Abuja
