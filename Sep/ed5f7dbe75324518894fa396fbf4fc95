The ruling All Progressives Congress, APC says the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party, PDP is a dead party which has nothing to offer Nigerians. APC asked PDP members who share its progressive ideals to leave the sinking and rudderless ship and come over to the ruling party which is rebuilding and repositioning the country in all facets. The ruling party urged the PDP to quickly wake up to the reality that the 2019 presidential elections have been won and lost. Yekini Nabena, APC acting National Publicity Secretary stated this Sunday while reacting to the allegations by the Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike that APC has sponsored some PDP presidential aspirants. Nabena said, “it is understandable that the PDP in its despair over its failed 2019 election bid for the presidency has resorted to comical conspiracies”. According to him, “instead of putting it house in order, it is laughable that Governor Wike and his PDP cohorts are clutching on straws it is desperate bid to remain in public reckoning in the face of imminent 2019 defeat. “Meanwhile, we challenge Governor Wike to be brave enough and name the APC-sponsored aspirants among the crowd that have signified interest to run for the presidency under the PDP”, the Spokesman charged.
