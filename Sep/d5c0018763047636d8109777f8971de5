Lagos State governor, Akinwunmi Ambode on Wednesday broke his long silence on the crisis over his second term bid, saying he was ready and prepared to participate the Saturday’s governorship primary election. A source told BusinessDay that the governor may have been given a soft landing by the leadership of his party, and that the outcome of the Osun governorship in which the opposition People Democratic Party (PDP) almost won, played a role, and that the governor had agreed to some conditionalities given by the party. Members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) across the state are expected this Saturday choose the party’s flagbearer through direct primaries. Ambode in statement issued by Kehinde Bamigbetan, his commissioner for information and strategy, said he is restating his readiness in line with the choice of the party in Lagos State and the validation given to the direct primary preference by the Governor’s Advisory Council (GAC). “As our great party approaches Saturday, September 29, 2018, earmarked for the direct primary election to choose the candidate to fly our party’s gubernatorial flag at the next general election, I am happy to restate my commitment to participate in that process having procured and submitted my nomination form and having formally declared my intention to seek a second term to continue on the path of unprecedented growth and development that our state has witnessed since 2015”. The governor expressed gratitude to Bola Ahmed Tinubu, the national leader of the party and most influential personality in the Lagos politics, party elders and executives; GAC members; all APC members and Lagosians “whose support, understanding and prayers have assisted me in no small measure in being used as an instrument through which our state has redefined the concept of greatness”. The statement added that the governor in seeking re-election is approaching the founding fathers and teeming members of the party with a “grateful heart, open arms and a pledge to open and deeper attention to the concerns of this one, big family”. The statement added that a return of the party’s ticket to Ambode will guarantee the stability of the state’s growing economy; ensure the continuation of the growth and development it has witnessed over time and ensure that the opposition does not take root in the State. The statement congratulates the governor’s co-contestants for the courage and commitment to the party and urges party faithfuls to come out en masse and vote peacefully in all the 20 local governments and 245 wards where the election will take place.
