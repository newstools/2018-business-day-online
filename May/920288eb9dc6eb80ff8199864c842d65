Adams Jagaba, chairman, House Committee on Interior during Wednesday plenary formally announced his defection from All Progressive Congress (APC) to Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Jagaba who hails from Kaduna is a third term members in the Lower Chamber, had earlier announced his defection during a rally held in Kaduna state. The defection letter came few months after Speaker Yakubu Dogara frowned at Jagaba’s verbal notice, hence directed him to follow the due process as a ranking member. Jagaba in the letter read by the Speaker frowned at his suspension from the party at the state level. He said that the party suspended him for being vocal against the killing of innocent Nigerians across the country. “My unwarranted suspension by the party because I was vocal against the killings in the state and across the country made me take that decision,” the Kaduna lawmaker explained.
