Sequel to the violence that disrupted the Saturday All Progressive Party (APC) Governorship Primary election in Ekiti State, the ruling party has threatened to disqualify Kayode Fayemi, Minister of Mines and steel, Babafemi Ojudu, Special Adviser to the President on Political matters as well as Bimbo Daramola, former member of House of Representatives. This is because the supporters of these Governorship Aspirants had allegedly perpetrated the violence that marred the primary elections leading to its postponement. Consequently, APC declared on Monday that all the aspirants whose agents or representatives were involved in the disruption of the primary election in Ekiti will be disqualified.
