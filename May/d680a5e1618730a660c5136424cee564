Deputy governor of Ekiti State and candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the forthcoming governorship election, Kolapo Olusola, has said he is ready to take over the mantle of governorship in the state. The deputy governor stated this in Abuja on Wednesday while receiving his certificate of return from the party’s national leadership, having emerged its candidate ahead of the July 14, 2018 governorship election. Olusola, who was received by the deputy national chairman of the party (South), Yemi Akinwonmi, added that PDP is prepared to win the governorship election regardless of the money or violence the All Progressives Congress (APC) will unleash in the state. He said “I want to assure our national leaders that Ekiti is for PDP. All the other parties are just shouting. Let them bring money, let them bring violence, Ekiti people will resist them. We are no more interested in accommodating unnecessary interlopers. People want to take us through another round of economic slavery. We are no more ready for that. I am ready and prepared to take up this challenge as the incoming governor of Ekiti State on the platform of the PDP.” Olusola who mocked the APC over its recent botched governorship primary, added that there is a big difference between the PDP and the other parties in the state. He hailed his Boss Governor Ayodele Fayose, describing him as a fearless leader who is standing on the side of the truth. The deputy national chairman of the party, Yemi Akinwonmi, said PDP has shown through the outcome of its governorship primary in Ekiti State that it is the only democratic party. He accused the APC of bringing bloodshed and chaos to Ekiti State through their primaries. The national organising secretary, Austin Akobundu, described the primary as the most transparent in the party’s recent history. Olusola emerged winner of the PDP primary, having secured 1,190 votes to defeat Dayo Adeyeye who garnered 771 votes.  OWEDE AGBAJILEKE, Abuja
