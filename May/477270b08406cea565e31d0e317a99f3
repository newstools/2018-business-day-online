Significant growth in revenue For the first three months through March 2018, Wapic Insurance grew gross premium written by 18.30 percent to N4.46 billion from N3.77 billion the previous year.

Other operating profit decreased by 56.26 percent to N11.03 million in the period under review from N25.34 million as at March 2017.

The company’s pretax profit fell by 16.85 percent to N319.37 million in March 2018 from N384.10 million the previous year.

With respect to insurance claims paid out, the insurer’s insurance claims, net claims, and underwriting expenses form total underwriting expenses which increased by 26.23 percent to N1.15 billion in March 2018 from N911.01 million as at March 2017. Further scrutiny of the financial statement shows net claims grew by 6.57 percent to N691.47 million in March 2018 from N648.84 million the previous year.

This means the insurer has spent on claims expenses to generate every N100 in premium income. Underwriting expenses fell to 20.60 percent in March 2018 from 27.62 percent the previous year.
