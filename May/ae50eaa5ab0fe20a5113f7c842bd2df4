Former Governor of Edo State and National Chairmanship aspirant of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Adams Oshiomhole, has said the party cannot fix the rot caused by PDP’s 16 years misrule in three years. He stated this in Abuja on Tuesday when he met with the party’s caucus at the Senate. The former President of Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), promised a cordial working relationship between the Executive and the Legislature if elected as the party’s chairman. “I believe that working and getting support from all of you that together we can re-brand our party, strengthen it, give it a more positive image, giving our owners a sense of ownership and participation and together we will confront the forthcoming election and remind Nigerians that even if we haven’t fixed all the problems, there is no question that there is a genuine commitment to begin to address those problems and that we can’t fix in three years what was destroyed in 16 years and a journey of a million miles starts with one correct step. “We have duty to reassure Nigerians that this party is capable of delivering and sustaining the change that we promised. “I believe that given the opportunity to chair our party, there are couple of things we must necessarily do differently. “And when we approach matters with an open mind, we can do business. I am confident that working with leaders with open mind, all of these issues can be resolved,” he said. Responding, Senate President Bukola Saraki, expressed confidence in the ability of the chairmanship aspirant to deliver on his campaign promises. He thereafter urged the media and other aides to excuse them. Unlike what transpired in the House of Representatives last week when members of the APC Caucus endorsed Oshiomhole for the position of National Chairman of the party, APC senators, however failed to endorse him. Speaking with journalists after the closed-door meeting, Oshiomhole described it as ‘fruitful’.  OWEDE AGBAJILEKE, Abuja
