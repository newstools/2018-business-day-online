The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) during the weekend released its first quarter 2018 report, which indicated that Automated Teller Machine (ATM) transactions dominated the volume of transactions in the banking sector. The report showed that 212,370,853 volume of ATM transactions valued at N1,568 billion were recorded in the first quarter of 2018. A total volume of 457,226,406 transactions valued at N32.48 trillion were recorded in Q1 2018 as data on Electronic Payment Channels in the Nigeria Banking Sector revealed. “It means that the economy is driven by use of debit cards”, said Ayodeji Ebo, managing director, Afrinvest Securities limited. Ebo said there need for the banking sector to do a lot more enlightenment programmes to encourage customers to use other electronic channels like PoS. He noted that business owners are discouraged by high charges on PoS and therefor prefer to collect cash from customers. There is need to review charges on PoS for business owners and to encourage the use of other cashless electronic transaction channels, Ebo said.
