Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina has come under attack for declaring that Presidency cannot guarantee President Muhammadu Buhari’s return within the stipulated four days given for his medical trip to London. BusinessDay gathered at the Presidential Villa, Thursday, that Adesina was verbally queried by the Chief of Staff to the President, Abba Kyari, over the telephone interview he granted to the Channels Television breakfast Programme, Sunrise Daily, Adesina had in response to one of the questions stated that
“When you talk of guarantee, man cannot guarantee. Nobody can guarantee anything.” Adesina was asked by the Channels crew ” If it is guaranteed that Buhari’s stay in London will not exceed four days” Adesina however expressed hopes that the President ” will be back in the country on Saturday by the grace of God” even as he added that ” On Monday and Tuesday, he will visit Jigawa State.” But BusinessDay Villa sources Thursday, revealed that Kyari had invited Adesina to his office where he literally lambasted him for saying that “nobody can guarantee anything” Our source also hinted of his overbearing attitudes as he is regularly seen breathing down heavily on other Political appointees This is not the first time Kyari is involved in such verbal attacks with his fellow political appointees On first of November, 2017, at the swearing in of the new Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF) and the official launching of the 2018 Armed Forces Remembrance Day celebrations and Emblems , Kyari was involved in similar attacks with the Head of Service of the Federation, Winifred Oyo-Ita. BusinessDay also gathered that although the Office of the Chief of Staff to the President is created to assist the President in coordinating his personal Staff, in achieving optimum performance , the current Chief of Staff has performed below expectations. Part of his duties include the supervision of key presidency staff, controlling access to the office of the President as well as managing communications and information flow. Other major roles include facilitating smooth relationship between the executive branch and the National Assembly, as well as smooth relationship between the Ministries, Departments and agencies ( MDA) and the National Assembly The Chief of Staff traditionally ensure good relationship between the office of the President and external political groups to implement the president’s agenda. The current Chief of Staff has played very little roles in removing frictions between political appointees and the National Assembly which is partly blamed for the lingering Executive Legislature imbroglio and the long delay in the passage of the 2018 budget despite the massive control of the National Assembly by the All Progressive Congress ( APC) led government.
