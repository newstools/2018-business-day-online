…As BusinessDay publishes list of registration exercise venues in Lagos Monday.  Following the widespread complaints by many prospective voters in Lagos about their inability to track the venues for the continuous voter registration to enable them prepare for the forth coming general election, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in the state has urged residents to avail themselves of the opportunity of the published venues. The comprehensive list of the venues for the rotational schedule in Lagos State is available at INEC’s offices in the state. The list, containing the venues in the twenty local government areas of Lagos State, obtained by BusinessDay will be published in full in the Monday edition of the newspaper. To be published also is the transfer procedure for those who wish to transfer from one part of the state to the other as well as those who want to transfer from one state to the other. A breakdown of the registration venues released to BusinessDay by the Lagos office of INEC indicates that registration centres are rotated within the INEC offices in the LGAs and some other special registration venues mostly public primary and secondary schools across the state. Recall that there have been so much complaints over the seemingly difficulty in obtaining the permanent voter’s card (PVC) ahead of the 2019 general election.
INEC had last year April commenced a continuous voter registration exercise, citing inadequate funds to continue with the former format in which the commission carried out the exercise in wards across the country.  Iniobong Iwok
