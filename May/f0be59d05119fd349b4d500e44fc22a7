As tension continues to build in the days leading to the Ekiti state gubernatorial elections, the APC gubernatorial candidate for the July 14th elections and Minister of solid minerals Kayode Fayemi has declared incumbent governor, Ayo Fayose an enemy of the state. Speaking on a political show on channels TV in Ado-Ekiti, the minister stated that he would not be contesting if he hadn’t consulted with the president and secured his support and blessings. This declaration puts a new twist to the political ecosystem in Ekiti as federal might and its apparatus are now expected to play a major part in the election and possibly the outcome, given the process that led to the emergence of the minister as APC candidate. Describing the incumbent governor Fayose as “the common enemy of Ekiti state people”, Fayemi said the governor has spent the last three and half years doing nothing but taking the state back. Governor Fayose, has been a leading voice in the opposition party PDP and have taking every chance to criticize the APC led government, it’s policies and even the person of President Buhari and whom he often describe as unfit and unqualified to lead the Nation. There are notions that should the PDP be edged out of the July 14th elections,  incumbent governor Fayose will be made to pay for his criticism of the President. Fayemi noted that he’s not compelled by law to resign as minister until thirty days to the election but he will resign in two weeks. In what many following the polity in Ekiti have described as a show of unity in the Ekiti state chapter of the APC, the Minister said “I had spent the entire day visiting my co-contestants from Segun Oni to Senator Gbenga Aluko. I have visited 12 of my co –contestant today and we’ve had very fruitful conversation concerning who we consider to be the common enemy of the state.”
