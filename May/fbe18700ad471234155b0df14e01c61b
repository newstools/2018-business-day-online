Analysts view Bismarck J. Rewane, managing director/CEO, Financial Derivatives Company Limited said at LBS Executive Breakfast Meeting that investors remained lukewarm as the market appeared overpriced. “NSE performance will be driven by economic developments – minimum wage review, increased oil revenue, higher output (positive GDP growth), improvements in leading economic indicators to improve investor sentiments, and downward drift in T-Bills rates to further bolster domestic transaction on the bourse”, Rewane noted. Equity research analysts at Lagos-based Vetiva Capital said that “The decline in market activity has come amid cooling market sentiment and increased risk aversion after the initial January rally (market closed 16percent higher in January) and ahead of the 2019 elections”. They noted that following an initial surge in market activity at the start of the year (January daily average: N8.9 billion), trading turnover has moderated in recent months, falling from a daily average of N6.9 billion in first-quarter (Q1) of 2018 to N5billion so far in May. Vetiva equity analysts also stated that domestic investors have not provided the expected support in the market as implementation of Pension Commission (PenCom) multi-fund guidelines has stalled. “Given all this, we do not expect trading activity to pick up significantly in the near-term as investors continue to monitor political developments”, the analysts noted. “In the meantime, we strongly advise investors to take a keen interest on firms’ fundamentals before taking an investment position. We equally advise on taking a medium-long term view of the market”, GTI researchers said in their May 1 note to investors.
