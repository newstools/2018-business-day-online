The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has presented the report of its investigation into the allegation of underage voting during the February 10 local government election in Kano State. The commission absolved itself of any complicity in the allegation of underage voting. INEC chairman, Mahmood Yakubu, who disclosed the outcome of the investigation during a press conference in Abuja on Friday, said that based on the terms of reference of the Abubakar Nahuche Committee, and given that the INEC voter register was given to the Kano State Independent Electoral Commission, which was not substantially used during the voting process, “it is logical to to conclude that if underage voting occurred in the election, it was not due to any presence of underage registrants on the Voter Register.” “However, after examining some of the images in circulation, the committee found that they have been available long before the Kano Local Government Elections. the few images and video clips from Kano show no accreditation of voters or any relationship with the Register of Voters.
