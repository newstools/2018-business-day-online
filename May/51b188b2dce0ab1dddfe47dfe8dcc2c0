Ali Ahmad, speaker, Kwara State House of Assembly, has identified inability of the three arms of government to function independently as one of the problems threatening the nation’s democracy. Ahmad, in a statement issued on Monday by his Special Assistant on Media, Shuaib Abdulkadir, to commemorate Nigeria’s 19 years of uninterrupted democratic governance, stressed that it could get better. The speaker, who maintained that though every arm of government must find means to accommodate one another for the good of the citizens, posited that it was expedient that they work collectively but independently as enshrined in the 1999 Constitution. He pointed out that irrespective of the challenges encountered over the years, democratic culture is evolving steadily in the country, just as he noted that, “though the achievements recorded might be short of the citizens’ expectations in all ramifications, there were signs that as a nation, we have continued to learn from the past mistakes.” He challenged governments at all levels to work assiduously towards ensuring that the dividends of democracy reach all the nooks and crannies of the country. “Nigeria is blessed with both human and capital resources, if harmonised successfully the nation stands to benefit immensely”, he said. Ahmad appreciated various roles played by individuals, group of people and social groups towards the attainment of the “hard earn democracy”.  SIKIRAT SHEHU, Ilorin
