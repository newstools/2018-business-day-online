Adams Oshiomhole, the immediate past governor of Edo State, on Thursday in Abuja, declared his intention to contest for the position of the National Chairman of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) political party. Oshiomole who arrived the Transcorp Hilton Hotel Abuja venue of the declaration ceremony about noon, was been received by the top echelon of the APC across the country, amidst jubilation which enveloped the packed full hall. Oshiomhole who was recently endorsed by President Muhammadu Buhari and a large number of APC governors is the first to formally declare his intention to contest for the coveted seat of APC Chairman. Apart from Oshiomhole, the current Chairman, Oyegun, former Cross River State Governor, Clement Ebiri and Minister of Science and Technology, Igbonnaya Onuh have indicated interest in the contest. With this declaration, Oshiomhole is being seen as the main challenger to the incumbent Oyegun, but many say that Oshiomhole’s endorsed by Buhari could indicate that Oyegun is on his way out of the position of party Chair. Interestingly, both Oyegun and Oshiomole are not just from Edo State, but former governors of their state.
