Union Bank of Nigeria (UBN) Plc, one of the nation’s oldest and reliable deposit money banks, announced its audited financial statements for the year ended 2017, as many of its financial ratios showed significant progress was made in the year that just ended.

The increase in the above ratios has been attributed to oversubscription of rights issue, launch of bespoke products and appetite for UBN services demonstrated through upsurge in new-to-bank customers.  “Following an oversubscribed rights issue that raised approximately N50 billion at the end of 2017, Union Bank now has a strengthened capital base to support business growth and maintain regulatory capital requirement”, UBN stated in a note to the Exchange.

Total income for the year was N24.6 billion in contrast to N25.4 billion in 2016.  “Strengthening our capital base through the Rights Issue was key for the Bank in 2017. Notwithstanding the challenges a tightened economy presented, the rights issue was 20% oversubscribed. This overwhelming success is credited to strong shareholder and investor confidence in Union Bank’s immediate and longer-term plans. With sufficient capital buffers, we are now in pole position to execute our growth agenda from 2018 onwards.  “Operationally, we continued to focus on growing our retail customer base and optimising customer experience with simpler, smarter banking solutions. We launched an upgraded suite of digital channels including UnionMobile, UnionOnline and our unique USSD banking code *826#, driving an increase in active subscribers above 100% on the mobile app and online banking platforms. Union Bank’s alternative banking platform remains the fastest growing in the industry”, Emeka Emuwa, GMD said in a note to the Exchange.
