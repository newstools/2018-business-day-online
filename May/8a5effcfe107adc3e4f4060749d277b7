Oshiomhole President Muhammadu Buhari and former governor of Edo State, Adams Oshiomhole, ahead the June 2, national convention of the All Progressives Congress, met behind closed doors, at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. Oshiomhole is the main front runner and so far, the sole candidate for national chairmanship of the ruling party, was accompanied to the meeting by the chairman of the All Progressive Governorsâ€™ Forum, and Imo state governor, Rochas Okorocha. Although neither Oshiomhole nor Okorocha agreed to speak with State House Correspondents on the purpose of their visit, BusinnessDay gathered that the visit may not be unconnected with current efforts to give Okorocha a safe landing in is his current battle to regain control of the party structures in Imo state. The President had also recently asked all the APC governors to throw their weights behind Oshiomhole to enable him clinch the chairmanship position of the ruling party. BusinessDay also gathered that the ongoing crises trailing the just concluded local government congresses in the ruling party were equally discussed. Recall that most states emerged from the congresses with parallel party Executive at the grass root level, a situation that is said to be giving the stakeholders sleepless nights.  Tony Ailemen, Abuja
