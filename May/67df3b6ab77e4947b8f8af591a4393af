A statement from the finance ministry on Tuesday, said that the delegation will discuss ongoing World Bank projects and the country’s development priorities with the Vice President, Minister of Finance and the Governors. The officials will also meet the organised private sector in Lagos as well as undertake a tour of LAPO Microfinance project in Lagos and Azura Power Plant in Edo State. The visit is expected to provide a first-hand impression of the challenges that both the Federal and State Governments face in implementing development projects as well as ensuring good governance overall. It will further enhance the goal of the Bank for member-countries and the effectiveness of the Executive Directors in providing the necessary support.  Onyinye Nwachukwu, Abuja
