International Organization For Migration (IOM), on Monday, said the number of Mediterranean Migrants to Europe dropped in 143 days from 60,518 in 2017 to 28,368 in 2018. IOM, United Nations (UN), Migration Agency, stated this in its May report on the Missing Migrants Project that was released in Geneva. According to the organisation, 28,368 migrants and refugees entered Europe by sea through the first 143 day days of 2018, with about 38 percent arriving in both Italy and Greece. The remaining 23 percent mostly arrived in Spain, excluding the 47 migrants registered as arriving in Cyprus. The IOM, moreover said it has recovered remains of a Nigerian woman migrant, aged 21, on the Durance River along the dangerous route from Italy to France that crosses the Alps.
