With nine months to the 2019 general elections, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has inaugurated its Contact and Mobilization Committee. Chaired by the former Cross Rivers State governor, Liyel Imoke, the committee is saddled with the responsibility of initiating talks with other political parties willing to align forces with it to oust the governing All Progressives Congress (APC) in the forthcoming polls. In his remarks while inaugurating the committee at the party’s national secretariat in Abuja on Friday, PDP National Chairman, Uche Secondus, tasked members of the committee to reach out to political groups on the need to forge a common front for the political salvation of the country. According to him, the past three years of the President Muhammadu Buhari administration has convinced Nigerians of the need for a credible alternative in 2019. He explained that the decision to reach out to other political parties was informed by his open door policy aimed at making the party the preferred platform for all Nigerians. He said: “Your committee and your nomination into it is a well articulated decision of the party leadership to bring our open door policy to fruition. Just as your name connotes, you are to deploy your well versed network to help open the space and allow into our party, all those whose union with us can help in rescuing this country. Like we always say in this party, this umbrella is big enough to accommodate all people of patriotic ideals”. Responding, Imoke promised to work effortlessly to deliver on the mandate given to them. Other members of the committee include former governors Babangida Aliyu (Niger), Sule Lamido (Jigawa), and Gabriel Suswam (Benue). Others are former Aviation Minister Kema Chikwe, her counterpart in Defence Haliru Bello, former Director General, National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC), Paul Orhii amongst others.
