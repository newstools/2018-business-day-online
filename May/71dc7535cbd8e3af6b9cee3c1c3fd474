According to Buhari, the leadership of APC in the state was satisfied with the fact that “Kwara APC remains a benchmark for inclusive and participatory democracy in Nigeria.
“Meanwhile, before the ward congress, we assured party members of level playing ground. We strictly adhered to the assurance and also ensured that the entire process was fair and credible.
“The party commends all party members for the impressive turn out and their peaceful conduct before, during and after the ward congress.
“Furthermore, the party acknowledges the commendable roles played by all security agencies in Kwara state to maintain peace and orderliness before, during and after the ward congress.
“Kwara APC remains united and formidable under the leadership and guidance of the Senate President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, Abubakar Bukola Saraki, CON. The contributions of our leader towards the success of the ward congresses cannot be quantified. We shall continue to stand by our leader through thick and thin,” the statement said.
