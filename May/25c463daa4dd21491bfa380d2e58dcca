As Nigeria struggles to overcome its numerous challenges, the Centre for Anti-corruption and Open Leadership (CACOL) has said that only the practice of true federalism in the country could guarantee good governance and development in the country. Executive Chairman of CACOL, Debo Adeniran said this yesterday at the exploratory conference on the Lagos Open Parliament (part four) conducted by the organisation and held at the Right House, Adeniyi Jones, Lagos State, noting that the over concentration of governance on the centre and only on a tier of government was affecting service delivery to the citizenry especially by the local government area whose function had been taken over by the various states government in the country. Adediran said that the Lagos Open Parliament (LOP) was initiated to allow the centre focus on periodic analyses of governmentâ€™s general performance in the state, adding that it utilises public and media assessment with the goal of ensuring accountability in governance. He said the centre carries out the research by gathering citizens from all the local government areas in the state to give individuals collective opinion about governance in the state. Several of the discussants at the event charged government at all levels to be more accountable and transparent in disclosing the cost of executing public projects and contract expenditure. A lawyer, Olumide Fusika advocated for more synergy between the state and the local government areas for good governance in the country, stressing that the over-concentration of governance in the centre had made governance to be far from Nigerians.
