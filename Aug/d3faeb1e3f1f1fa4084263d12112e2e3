The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) says the open directive by the All Progressives Congress (APC) to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) and the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) to quickly conclude the investigation and prosecution of key opposition leaders before the 2019 elections, has further confirmed that the agencies have been compromised and are being tele-guided by the ruling party against the opposition. Particularly, the party drew the attention of Nigerians and the international community to APC’s direct directive to the EFCC to drag in Deputy Senate Ike Ekweremadu on trumped-up charges, stampede his prosecution and put him out of circulation before the 2019 elections. A statement on Sunday by Kola Ologbondiyan, PDP National Publicity Secretary, urged Nigerians to hold the APC and Buhari Presidency responsible, should any harm befall any PDP leader as the 2019 elections draw near. “The PDP notes that it was not a mere coincidence that EFCC’s invitation to Ekweremadu was dated July 24, 2018, the same morning his residence and that of the Senate President, Dr. Bukola Saraki, were simultaneously besieged by EFCC operatives and hundreds of policemen, in a failed attempt to illegally impeach them. “The series of interference by the APC in the work of the anti-graft agencies, coupled with the August 7, 2018 siege to the National Assembly by the Department of State Security, confirms a sinister plot by the APC-led administration not only to arrest and detain Saraki and Ekweremadu to illegally remove them, but also to besmear and destroy the opposition ahead of 2019 general elections. “Being unable to find Ekweremadu wanting in its many probes, the APC now relies on procured cooked-up allegations in a bid to get at him at all cost. “Is it not ironical that the same government, that was quick to explain that a serving military officer bought his Dubai property from his savings, does not think that a former Local Government Chairman, former Chief of Staff to Governor, former Secretary to Enugu State Government, Senator since 2003, Deputy Senate President since 2007, former Speaker of ECOWAS Parliament, and owner of a thriving law firm has earned enough legitimate incomes to invest in real estate. “While the PDP is not in any way against the war against corruption in our country, we reject the illegal use of the EFCC and ICPC as political tools by the APC to harass, intimidate and drag down opposition members, in their failed bid to weaken the opposition ahead of the 2019 general elections,” the statement reads.
