Manchester United wrapped up their pre-season campaign with a 1-0 away defeat to Bayern Munich after Jose Mourinho warned the club that they face a “difficult season” if they do not act quickly in the transfer market. Mourinho was able to call upon Marcus Rashford in Munich as the England forward started alongside Alexis Sanchez and Juan Mata in attack, with summer signing Fred lining up in midfield.] However, United were on the back foot for much of Sunday evening’s friendly, with David De Gea busy at one end as Manuel Neuer was rarely troubled at the other. Bayern deservedly took the lead with a close-range header from a corner just before the hour-mark, and in truth Mourinho may secretly be pleased that his side restricted the German champions to just one goal on the night. Mourinho afforded game time to plenty of youth talent as the match petered out, but with United’s Premier League campaign opening against Leicester City on Friday night at Old Trafford, Mourinho left both the United hierarchy and fans under no illusions as to his side’s chances of silverare this season. Speaking ahead of the match to MUTV, Mourinho said: “My CEO [Ed Woodward], he knows what I want for quite a long time, he knows what I want. “I know that he tries the best for me. I still have a few days to wait (for) what is going to happen.”
It was then suggested to Mourinho that he was not satisfied with his squad – a statement he did not deny – and when asked why that was, he replied: “Because the other clubs that compete with us, they are really strong.
“Or they already have fantastic teams and squads like Chelsea, Tottenham, Manchester City… or they are investing massively like for example Liverpool that is buying everything and everybody. “So if we don’t make our team better it will be a difficult season for us.”
