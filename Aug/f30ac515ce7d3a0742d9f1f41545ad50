As the time frame for the collection of nomination forms for aspirants and candidates of political parties ahead of their primaries elapsed on Friday, August 24, the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and the main opposition People’s Democratic Party (PDP) appear to be uncertain about the primaries, even as they appeared not to have obtained the forms. According to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) time table, 17 to 24 August was slated for “collection of forms for all elections by political parties to issue to their candidates,” from the INEC headquarters. BusinessDay however, reliably learnt that the APC has not collected forms at INEC headquarters for issuance to their candidates at the expiration of the period for that exercise. Similarly the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party, PDP has neither collected the forms as specified in the INEC time table.  Innocent Odoh and James Kwen, Abuja
