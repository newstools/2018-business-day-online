Finally, the House of Representatives’ Committee on Electoral Matters is holding meeting with top officials of Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) on the 209 election budget. The meeting which is ongoing at the National Assembly, Abuja, will be followed by another meeting with the Senate. The Senate President, Bukola Saraki and Speaker Yakubu Dogara had in a statement issued on Tuesday explained that the meeting between the Joint Senate and House of Representatives Committees on Electoral Matters and officials of the INEC earlier scheduled ahead of Monday August 13, 2018, could not hold. They however stated that the “joint committees were also expected to meet with the joint Senate and House Committees on Appropriations, Loans and Debts on the Eurobond loan request after which two reports would have been ready for presentation in the two chambers. “However, no such meeting had taken place yet as a result of which both Senate and House of Representatives cannot reconvene as there is no report to consider. “Until the Committees have a ready report for the consideration of the two chambers, it will be most irresponsible to recall members from recess especially those that may have travelled to Saudi Arabia for the Hajj,” the statement read.
