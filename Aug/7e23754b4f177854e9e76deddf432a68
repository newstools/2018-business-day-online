Arturo Vidal, new FC Barcelona signing says his aim is to win the UEFA Champions League three times over his three-year deal. The La Liga champions signed the 31-year-old Chile midfielder from Bayern Munich for a reported fee which could rise to 21 million euros (£18.73 million). He was officially presented at the Nou Camp on Monday. “To arrive at FC Barcelona is a much bigger step than FC Bayern Munich,” Vidal told reporters. “I hope to be an addition who can help to win all the titles. With the confidence that the people have given me, I want to win it all. “At 15, I promised my mother I would be one of the best. I’ve played for a lot of teams and now I’m arriving at the best in the world.” Vidal, who won Serie A with Juventus four times between 2012 and 2015, and the Bundesliga in each of his three seasons at Bayern, has never lifted the European Cup. FC Barcelona last won the UEFA Champions League in 2015, beating Vidal’s Juventus in the final match, and rivals Real Madrid have won it in each of the three seasons since. The UEFA Champions League defending champions twice knocked out FC Bayern Munich when the Chilean was with them. “I don’t have accounts to settle with anybody, just my objective, which is to win the UEFA Champions League, not settle scores with Real Madrid,” said Vidal. “I hope to win three UEFA Champions League titles in the three years I will be here.”
