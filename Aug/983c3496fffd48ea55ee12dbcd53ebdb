To analysts at the United Capital, the prominence of penny stocks on the table of equities that outperformed the capital and money market returns may not necessarily be connected to their half year results but due to the increased activities of local retail investors.  “It is a pity that notable stocks with very impressive half year results are not outperforming the market currently except the penny stocks which are not attractive to foreign and institutional investors because their market capitalisation is thin and transactions in their shares are very low. They are only attractive to local retail investors. When conditions are favourable again, market rally will start from the well-capitalised stocks which are naturally attractive to foreign and institutional investors”, Kayode Tinuoye, head, research department at the United Capital, said.  “The downward trend in the market will reverse when major investors are confident that the political risks around the forthcoming general elections are effectively managed”, Tinuoye added.  The All Share Index (ASI) closed last Friday at 35,430.68 points representing 0.47 percent week to date gain and -7.35 percent year to date negative returns. In the same manner, the market capitalisation of listed equities closed at N12.93 trillion which amounted to N58.38 billion appreciation in the values of equities week to date and a loss of N676.17 billion in market capitalisation year to date.  Among the sub sectoral indexes, only the NSE Premium Index closed in the positive territory at 1.66 percent YTD.  The components of the NSE Premium Index are FBN Holdings, Seplat, UBA, Wapco, Access Bank, Zenith Bank and Dangote Cement.
