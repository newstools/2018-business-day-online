Spanish giants Real Madrid are set to tempt  Chelsea’s resolve with a £200 million offer for Eden Hazard. The Spanish giants are yet to fill the void created by Cristiano Ronaldo’s sale to Juventus. Although the English transfer window closed earlier this week, European clubs are still able to sign Premier League players up until the August 31st deadline. Real have already explored the option of prising Neymar and Kylian Mbappe from Paris Saint-Germain but the Ligue 1 champions are adamant their star players will not be sold at any price. Hazard enjoyed a stellar World Cup with Belgium, helping them to a third placed finish and has regularly spoken of his desire to play at the Bernabeu. The 27-year-old hinted he was ready to leave Chelsea after six years in west London earlier this summer but the FA Cup holders insist their prize asset will not be sold at any cost. Hazard returned to training on Monday and made a superb cameo appearance in Saturday’s 3-0 win over Huddersfield in Maurizio Sarri’s first game in charge. The former Lille ace is, however, refusing to enter into fresh talks over an extension to his current deal which ends in just under two year’s time. The Express claims the Real hierarchy will meet this week in a bid to settle on a Galactico-style target and are likely to offer a near world-record fee which they feel could tempt Chelsea into selling Hazard.
