The Minister of Women Affairs and Social Development, Senator Aisha Alhassan, has resigned from the federal cabinet to contest the governorship election in Taraba State next year.  Similarly, President Muhammadu Buhari has also accepted her resignation.  Alhassan had recently declared her intention to contest 2019 governorship election in Taraba, under the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC).  She openly pledged her loyalty to her political godfather, former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, of the main opposition party, Peoples Democratic Party, PDP recently.  Alhassan was given control of the APC structure in Taraba State during the last congress of the party. She contested the governorship election in 2015, but lost.  However, in his official response to the minister’s resignation letter President Buhari said: “I have today received your letter notifying me of your intention to contest for the governorship of Taraba State in the 2019 election. Let me thank you on behalf of the Federal Executive Council and Nigerians for your services as minister under this administration. I note with passion your past contribution to our great party APC during and after the 2015 elections.  “As you are aware I am totally committed to free and fair elections. Our policy is to support all APC candidates. I wish you well in your ambition to be governor of your state. Rest assured that all security agencies as well as INEC will have my full support to conduct free, fair and transparent elections in 2019.”
