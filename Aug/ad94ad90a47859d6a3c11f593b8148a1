Management of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has distanced the oil company and its group managing director, Maikanti Baru, from the ongoing political tango in the National Assembly.   The corporation also distanced self from the trending reports in some section of the media insinuating that its helmsman had doled out funds to effect the impeachment of Senate president, Bukola Saraki. The corporation in a statement issued by its group general manager, group public affairs division, Ndu Ughamadu, described the report as the handiwork of mischief makers seeking to drag the NNPC and its GMD into a purely political affair totally different from its mandate, saying “Count Us Out of Ongoing Politicking in National Assembly – NNPC says Baru not Funding alleged Impeachment Plot Against Senate President.” The NNPC emphasised that the report was not only false but also an affront on the verifiable reforms in the operations of the corporation under Baru, which has witnessed irreversible strides in the area of transparency leading to the sustained publication of NNPC monthly operations and financial records. The corporation called on all well-meaning members of the public and oil and gas industry stakeholders to discountenance the said story, noting that the management of the NNPC remained committed to its statutory role and responsibility to the entire federation.
