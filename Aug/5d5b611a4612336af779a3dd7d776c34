When I got the call to be at the premiere of the much awaited movie Moms at War, I knew it was a movie to watch. With a line up casts that include Funke Akindele, Omoni Oboli, Yul Edochie to mention a few, the movie certainly had it all, fun, laughter, enlightenment, tolerance and lessons to learn. From the beginning to the end, there was not a dull moment. Letâ€™s just say as you go to the cinemas to watch, trust me when I say you are in for a nice time. Moms at War is about two mothers (acted by Funke Akindele and Omoni Oboli), who lived in the same neighbourhood, but hated each other. One felt that the other was a village girl who just got into money and is not fit to be in society with them. The rivalry was so strong that it was glaring to everyone. I found their fight in the swimming pool hilarious. I also loved the way they made up. I enjoyed the interpretation of roles including the children. This is one movie you will surely enjoy with friends and family!  Kemi Ajumobi
