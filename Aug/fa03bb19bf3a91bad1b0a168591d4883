The decline in the returns from the Nigerian equities market has been a source of concern to investors. However, it also presents an opportunity for bargain hunters in high-value stocks to position for long term gains. This view was shared by Oby Chiki-Ijegbulem, managing director of Greenwich Securities Limited, at the Nigerian British Chamber of Commerce (NBCC)’s Members’ Evening, themed:  ‘Investment Opportunities in the Nigerian Capital Market’. According to Chiki-Ijegbulem, some shares listed on Nigerian Stock Exchange were trading below their  five-year lows and thus present an opportunity for discerning investors to position for long-term growth. “This is relatively a good time to strategically invest in the equities market,” she said. “Investors, however, need to access the right information, and build the tenacity to do so. A lot of people don’t have the necessary information; neither do they have the courage to invest,” She stated. While touching on other metrics that support investment in Nigeria’s financial market despite the downturn of equity prices, Chiki-Ijegbulem noted that in identifying opportunities, several factors need to be considered, including the underlying fundamentals of the target stock and the risks that may impact projected performance. ‘’We understand that these dynamics may not be exactly easy for everyone to coordinate and  we advise current and potential investors to contact veritable investment analysts or stockbrokers to guide them in taking decisions on investing in the equities market bearing in mind the risk involved,” she stated.
