The National Assembly leadership will meet on Tuesday over the possible reconvening of the federal legislature to consider some national issues, BusinessDay has learnt. The National Assembly leadership comprises both the Senate and the House of Representatives. It was gathered that the meeting is scheduled for 12noon on Tuesday. A source told BusinessDay that the meeting will be followed by another meeting with the leadership of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) led by its chairman, Mahmood Yakubu. On July 24, the National Assembly adjourned for annual recess till September 25, 2018 but has come under intense pressure to reconvene over pending national issues. Some of the pending issues include the approval of N242 billion virement request to fund the 2019 elections, approval of borrowings to fund the 2018 Appropriations Act and 2018 budget proposals of 64 government-owned corporations. The funds would enable the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to commence preparations for the 2019 polls. Also pending are confirmation of appointments for the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Independent Corrupt Practices and other related Offences Commission (ICPC), Assets Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON), Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) among others.
