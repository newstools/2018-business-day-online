Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom has said that those plotting to overthrow the President of the Senate, Bukola Saraki and his deputy, Ike Ekweremadu from the leadership of the National Assembly are enemies of the country’s democracy. The Governor said this in a statement he issued on Friday through his Chief Press Secretary, Terver Akase even as warned the plotters to desist from such nefarious act.He also urged the persons behind the plot to take a close look at the country’s Constitution as well as Senate rules to be properly guided. The Governor averred that though the election of a President of the Senate requires simple majority, removing the holder of the office takes two-thirds of the entire Senate members. He described the attacks on Saraki, including moves for his impeachment and threats to freeze his accounts as unfortunate developments, which must be condemned and resisted by all patriots. He added that Senator Saraki has demonstrated uncommon capacity to lead the Senate, pointing out that the President of the Senate has done nothing wrong in defecting from the All Progressives Congress, APC to the opposition Peoples Democratic Party, PDP. Governor Ortom wondered why those who defected from APC become targets for victimization by Federal Government agencies while those who moved from other political parties to the ruling party are celebrated as ‘saints’. He called on Nigerians to condemn the wave of impunity prevailing in the country, in the interest of democracy and nation-building. Armed hooded men from the Department of Security Service (DSS) invaded the National Assembly on Tuesday, August 7 in a failed move to allegedly instigate the impeachment of Saraki and Ekweremadu. Following the outcry that trailed the action, the Acting President, Yemi Osinbajo sacked the Director General of the DSS, Lawal Daura.  Innocent Odoh, Abuja
