Senate President Bukola Saraki has dismissed claims by the Presidency that its annual recess would lead to government shutdown. The National Assembly adjourned till September 25, 2018 although there had been immense pressure by the Presidency and APC lawmakers calling for the legislature to reconvene to approve the 2019 INEC budget and other pending national issues. Addressing a world press conference in Abuja on Wednesday on the invasion of the National Assembly Complex by operatives of the Department of State Services (DSS), he described the sack of Lawal Daura, Director General of the secret police as damage control. He called for investigation of the matter, even as he insisted that he would not resign as Senate President. The Senate President who recently defected from the All Progressives Congress (APC) to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), called on the President to immediately sign the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill already passed by both chambers of the National Assembly. As of the time of filing this report, the National Assembly leadership is currently meeting with top management of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) on the N242 billion 2019 elections budget.
