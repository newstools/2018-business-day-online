The new spiritual leader and head of mission of Gospel Church of Christ Worldwide, Bishop Eric Emiaso has challenged Nigerian youth to live above societal demands to attain their aspiration and dreams of a better life. The clergyman urged the youth to draw closer to God, and celebrate God’s goodness and believe in their given abilities to transform Nigeria’s political, economic and social landscape. Emiaso made the remark at the church annual convention that coincided with the 50th anniversary and transition of the church leadership. Emiaso therefore urged the youth to rise up and take their rightful place as the next generation of leaders in Nigeria. “You must rise up, get equipped, develop good vision and run with focus at this season and time to take position. God’s plan for you is to be strong enough to overcome any form of failure, oppression and intimidations that may hinder your development and achievement,” said Emiaso. Declaring that, instead of allowing themselves to be used for dirty jobs that will truncate their destinies, they should draw closer to God and remain steadfast with absolute trust in God to maximize their potentials and opportunities available for great impact and meaningful living that glorify God. The new head of mission of Gospel Church of Christ also used the opportunity to advised government on restructuring and careful handling of ongoing war against corruption, so as not to jeopardize the purpose of sanitizing the system and building a better society. He however called for unflinching support, cooperation and loyalty from church members for the new leadership with assurance that, God will move the church to the next level of higher height and the promise land.
