No fewer than 49 Senators in the upper chamber of the National Assembly this morning appended their signatures against the failed attempt to impeach the Senate President, Bukola Saraki, and the Deputy Senate President, Ike Ekweremadu. This development is coming just after operatives of the Department of State Services, DSS, invaded the Nigerian National Assembly and took over the complexes. The DSS operatives also denied many lawmakers, especially those loyal to Saraki and Ewkeremadu access to the chambers while allowing access to those under the All Progressives Congress, APC. Senator representing Bayelsa East, Ben Murray-Bruce, while leading other lawmakers against the alleged inversion, said APC senators are behind the inversion and that the APC senators planned on impeaching Saraki and Ekweremadu and installing Senator Godswill Akpabio as the Senate President. “The front gate has been blocked by DSS and police. The plan is to allow APC senators entry. Senators who will install Akpabio as the Senate President and impeach Saraki and Ekweremadu,” The Senator said the plot by the APC senators would not succeed as the PDP has the majority at the senate.
