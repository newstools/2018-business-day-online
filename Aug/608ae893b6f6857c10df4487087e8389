Nigeria’s total debt portfolio as at 30th June 2018 stood at N22.38 trillion ($72.2 bn), according to data obtained from the Debt Management Office (DMO). This debt stock composition comprises both external and domestic debt (FG+States+FCT) at $22.08bn and N15.63tn ($51.12bn) as at Q2 2018. However, while the countries total domestic debt stock saw a decline of 2.1 percent from N15.96tn in Q1 2018 to N15.63tn as at Q2, the external debt was flat at $22.08bn all through the 2nd quarter. This is because, unlike in Q1 when it raised US$2.5bn to supplement the $3bn it raised November last year, the Federal government did not tap the Eurobond market The FGN’s external debt obligations at end-June amounted to US$22.08bn, equivalent to 5.9 percent of 2017 GDP. This includes the external borrowings of the state governments, which are necessarily guaranteed by the FGN. In 2017, the DMO came up with a debt restructuring strategy aimed at increasing external debts from 23 percent to 40 percent, and cutting down on domestic debts from 77 to 60 percent so as to free up capital for the private sector. In line with this externalization strategy, the N1.95trn deficit in the FGN’s 2018 budget is to be covered by external and domestic borrowings of N850bn (US$2.8bn) and N790bn respectively as well as unspecified privatization proceeds of N310bn. The debt office said the federal government had so far borrowed a total of N410 billion locally to finance the N9.12 trillion 2018 budget, which was assented to on June 19 by President Muhammadu Buhari. According to the DMO Director General, Patience Oniha, there had been no foreign borrowing so far to support the 2018 budget. The debt office also said it has sent the request for a proposal to banks for an international bond offering that will see it raise as high as $2.8billion Eurobond to finance the 2018 budget, but it is waiting for the legislative arm of government to give a nod for the new borrowing. The ratio of the domestic debt to external debt is inching towards the target of 60:40 and the target of 75:25 between long-term domestic debt and short-term domestic debt. The ratio between domestic and external debt stood at 70:30 compared to 72:28 in December 2017 The above variables had resulted in lower interest rates for the benchmark FGN securities from about 18.5 per cent in January 2017 to 11-14 per cent in the first half of 2018. A small decline in obligations to the World Bank Group was balanced by a rise in debt due to bilateral creditors, notably the Exim Bank of China and Germany’s KFW (state-owned development bank). ICM are again the largest creditor group, and are likely to remain so due to the FGN/DMO policy of externalization of debt. From a financing perspective, it is worth noting that 60.1 percent of the debt stock is due to multilateral and bilateral creditors on concessional terms. There has been a surge in warnings about the sustainability of Nigeria’s public debt stock, some of them influenced by regret that commercial borrowings come without policy conditionality. At current levels, the FGN can comfortably service external debt of US$22bn from the earnings accruing from oil production of +/-2.0 mbpd.
