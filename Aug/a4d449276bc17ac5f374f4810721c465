Artyrama, an online platform for the sale of African contemporary art, has announced a week-long exhibition by John Madu in Lagos. Supported by Bombay Sapphire, the exhibition will commence with a one-hour fireside chat with the artist on August 17 at the Artyrama Popup Gallery, Ikoyi, and followed by a series of viewings stretching through August 24. A multi-disciplinary artist whose work is represented through personal iconographic symbols such as metaphors, texture, indigenous patterns and colours, John Madu has had two solo shows and has participated in group shows across the country. The philosophy behind his works rests on the premise that true art is based on a chain reaction to socio-economic issues or his immediate environment. In ‘Identity Tones’, his most recent work, Madu contemplates the effect of globalization on African identity using collages, portraiture, figurative symbolism and mixed media to bring it to life. The eclectic mix of source material is influenced by pop culture, African art history, music and lived experiences. “This work reflects the time that we live in. The spread of popular culture via social media has created an increase in cross-cultural contacts which is a good thing, but original cultural practices can be lost in the process,” Madu says about the collection. “‘Identity Tones’ captures how I interpret this new state of consciousness in this work,” he says. Since it launched in September 2017, Artyrama, which is focused on providing a platform for emerging African artists to showcase their works as well as widen the access to contemporary African art globally, has held series of online auctions and exhibitions showcasing the very best artists within its gallery, with each artist personally selected by its team of curators.
