Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State says his government’s partnership with Oshodi Arts and Gallery will put the state in the limelight and make it become one of the best tourism destinations in Nigeria. Akeredolu said this when the Chief Executive Officer of Oshodi Arts and Gallery, Sheyi Oshodi, paid a courtesy visit to the governor in Akure on Wednesday. The governor, represented by his Deputy, Agboola Ajayi, said that the government was ready and committed to the project as it would boost the state’s internally generated revenue. He said that the partnership was coming at a time when government was committed to keeping proper records of events, activities and all important achievements. He said that the state government was emulating Cross River in the area of art and culture to ensure that Ondo State was put to prominence. “This partnership is good to help bring back our lost heritage; it has been there for long; we need to showcase it,” he said. Also speaking, the Commissioner for Culture and Tourism, Mr Ismaila Olurimisi, said the partnership was at no cost to government. Olurimisi said it would be the maiden edition of Arts and Culture festival, as it would boost the economy of the state. The commissioner said the date had not been fixed but that arrangements had been concluded to make it a worthwhile event. Earlier, Oshodi said the partnership would absorb no fewer than 5,000 youths. He said the project would showcase different talents that youths in the state possessed, ranging from music, dancing, design, sculptural designs and painting, among others. He added that the partnership would go a long way to boost the economic base of the state.
