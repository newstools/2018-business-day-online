The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has confirmed that
its operatives raided the Abuja home of former Director General of the
State Security Service (SSS), Ita Ekpeyong and arrested him on
Thursday.
The Media Officer of the anti- corruption agency, Wilson Uwugaren, who
confirmed the development to BusinessDay, however did not give any
further details. “Yes it is true that the EFCC raided his house today,
that is all I can tell you”, Uwugaren responded to BusinessDay inquiry
on the matter.
However, sources have linked the raid on Ekpeyong’s Asokoro residence
at Number 46 Mamman Nasir Street and his subsequent arrest to funds
said to have been released to the DSS and NIA under former President
Goodluck Jonathan’s administration which was not fully utilized.
Appointed by former President Jonathan, Ekpeyong led the SSS between
2010 and 2015 when President Muhammadu took over and relieved him of
the job, replacing him with Lawal Daura, his kinsman.
Daura was Tuesday sacked by Acting President Yemi Osinbajo following
the siege of the DSS on the National Assembly.
