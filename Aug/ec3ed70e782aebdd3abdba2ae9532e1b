With supply of several larger grades coming back online following series of pipeline outages in the last couple of months, Nigeria’s oil exports are expected to rise to their highest in four months in October of 1.73 million barrels per day (bpd), from September’s 1.41 million bpd. According to Reuters, Africa’s largest oil producing country loading schedule for October will be the largest programme since June this year Although still smaller than last year’s 1.768 million bpd. The export plan for October will comprised 57 cargoes which is 7 cargoes lower compared with 48 cargoes in September’s loading schedule  as Agbami, Bonga, Escravos, Forcados Okono and Qua Iboe will load the highest in October with a combine 33 cargoes while several smaller streams like Amenam, Pennington, Okwori, okwuibome and Antan who have no export cargo in September will add at least one cargo in October while Brass River will add at least 5 cargoes. “This is a natural consequence of three factors, I will say. There is relative peace in the Niger-Delta, that is, militancy has abated. A corollary of this is that there has been no major pipeline damage or declaration of force majeure. The third factor is pure market dynamics. Oil prices hover around $70 per barrel and this is driving supply” Ayodele Oni, Energy Partner at Lagos-based Bloomfield Law Practice said on a phone interview. Over the past few years, Nigeria has being hit by swarm of problems, predominantly decreased crude production and exports, oil theft and pipeline attacks, stalled economic reforms and recovery, and the threat of oil price volatility as the sector remain cautiously optimistic about overcoming these upheavals in 2018. In May 2018, the Nigerian petroleum industry underwent production difficulties as outages at key pipelines supplying Forcados and Bonny Light grade crudes were out of commission. In particular, the shutdown of the Nembe Creek Pipeline in mid-May, which transports 150,000 bpd of Bonny Light to the Forcados terminal, caused Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria to declare a force majeure on Bonny Light crude exports. Although Shell declined to comment, there is speculation this shutdown was due to sabotage as Shell lifted the force majeure on July 13th, when repairs were completed. The shutdown, in conjunction with the closure of the leaking Trans-Forcados pipeline, which transports 200,000-240,000 bpd, led to further delays and an accumulation of unsold crude. According to S&P Global Platts, these factors caused Nigeria’s oil production to drop by 150,000 bpd from 1.88 mbpd in April, dropping it to 1.73 mbpd in May and 1.72 mbpd in June. The absence of investments into new fields have seen Nigeria’s oil reserves stagnate at 36.18 billion barrels, as at the first quarter of 2018, according to Ibe Kachikwu, minister of state for Petroleum Resources, at the recent Nigeria Oil and Gas (NOG) conference in Abuja. Africa’s biggest oil producer has targeted 40 billion barrels in reserves since 2010 but has not achieved the target due to dwindling rate of discoveries and further slump in investments in discovered fields. According to statistics from OPEC, Nigeria oil reserves decreased to 36.247 billion in 2011 from 37.200 billion recorded in 2010, while in 2012 there was relative improvement to 37.139 billion but went down again to 37.071 billion in 2013. In 2014, it stood at 37.448 billion before sliding down to 37.062 in 2015 while in 2016 it stood at 37.453 billion. According to the BP annual statistical bulletin released June 2017, OPEC member Iran has increased its oil reserves from 138 billion barrels in 2006 to 158 billion barrels in 2016. Iraq has moved from 115 billion barrels in 2006 to 153 billion barrels in 2016. Saudi Arabia has moved from 264.3 billion barrels in 2006 to 266.5 billion barrels in 2016. In this time period (2006 – 2016) total African reserves increased to 128 billion barrels from 116.9 billion barrels largely led by Angola and Libya.
