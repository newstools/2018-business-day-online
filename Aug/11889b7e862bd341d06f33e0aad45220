Nigerians who have earned a place in the much coveted Most Influential Global 100 list will be officially honoured by the Most Influential People of African Descent, MIPAD at the Nigerian Stock Exchange this August. In alliance with the International Decade for People of African Descent proclaimed by the UN’s General assembly, MIPAD seeks to identify high achievers of African Descent in public and private sectors. In 2017 the Initiative honoured a total of 200 Africans working in Africa and in diaspora in a stately dinner held in New York, USA. This year, MIPAD in conjunction with the Intra-African Trade Fair (IATF) will host Nigerians in the list of Africans (both in Africa and Diaspora) who are transforming the narrative of Global business, media, humanities and government at an exclusive reception in the Nigerian Stock Exchange and closing gong ceremony tagged ‘Celebration of Excellence’. There will also be the African Recognition week taking place in New York, USA to celebrate the MIPAD global finalists. Taking place in Egypt this October, the Intra-African Trade Fair (IATF) would unite over 1,000 exhibitors from across Africa and beyond and would attract more than 70,000 visitors, generating in excess of $70 billion in trade deals and thus boosting trade investments within the Continent.
Speaking about the forthcoming ceremony Kamil Olufowobi, CEO Most Influential 100 stated thus “over the years the contributions and impact of young and highly influential Africans have been neglected leaving a huge gap in the quest to inspire the next generation towards greater exploits. We are all about paving the way for Africans to embrace creativity and sustainable success within our peoples” MIPAD offers a viable platform to publicly celebrate and commend these pacesetters, spurring them on to greater heights.
