There is controversy trailing the time table released by the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC. According to the INEC time table, 17 to 24 August was slated for “collection of forms for all elections by political parties to issue to their candidates. But
Rotimi Lawrence, Chief Press Secretary to INEC Chairman told our correspondent that the commission is not to issue forms to any political party, hence that was strictly an internal party affairs. Also, Business Day reliably learnt that the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC has not collected forms at INEC headquarters for issuance to their candidates at the expiration of the period for that exercise. Similarly the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party, PDP has neither collected the forms as specified in the INEC time table. Though the APC Acting National Publicity Secretary, Yekini Nabena could not respond to calls and text messages to explain why the party was yet to collect the forms, credible sources in APC said, “the party can only do anything relating to primaries after its Thursday, August 30 National Executive Committee, NEC meeting”. For the PDP it was learnt that the party has not began any process leading to primaries, including the collection of forms from INEC. An official of the PDP who pleaded for anonymity said, “No, the party has done nothing yet. The party is walking a tight rope following the emergence of too many presidential aspirants on its platform. But we believe that in early September, things will take shape”. Further checks revealed that other political parties have not also collected the forms as stated in the INEC time table.  James Kwen, Abuja
