A member of the House of Representatives from Rivers State, Boma Goodhead, has forced her way into the National Assembly Complex. The PDP lawmaker who dared masked security men blocking the main entrance to the National Assembly to shoot her, was later allowed into the Complex alongside her colleagues who were initially barred from entering. However, journalists and other workers are still being barred as of the time of filing this report.  OWEDE AGBAJILEKE, Abuja
