The purpose of the mission was to harmonize all financial structures of the agric mechanization credit facility, and evaluate the terms and conditions. According to the ministry of agriculture “It is worthy of note that African countries such as Ghana, Senegal & Mozambique are already benefiting from the More Food Programme”, hence the need for Nigeria to secure membership within the shortest time possible. The Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development on its Twitter account, noted that earlier in May, 2017, following series of deliberations, Nigeria expressed interest to join the More Food International programme through the signing of the protocol of intention by Audu Ogbeh, Nigeria’s Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, on behalf of the country. The key objectives of the More Food membership for Nigeria according to the ministry of agriculture, include up-scaling its agriculture to improve food production/food security, create job & boost household income; intensify the degree of mechanization of Nigeria’s agriculture from tractors to harvesters and processors.
