Senators of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP alleged on Tuesday that they have been stopped from gaining access to the senate while senators from the ruling APC were being let in from the back door as the plot to force out Senate President Bukola Saraki who defected from the ruling All Peoples  Progressive party to the opposition PDP last week. The opposition senators allege that the senators from the ruling party and their sponsors were gathering inside the senate to perfect plans to remove the senate president and his deputy Ike Ekweremadu.
Senator Ben Murray Bruce representing Bayelsa said on national television that that he was turned away from the front gate by state security agents and indicated that his colleagues from the PDP were being allowed in.  According to the senator, “we are contacting embassies of the leading countries in the world including the US and the United Kingdom and telling them what is happening in the senate and asking that the visas of all those participating in this illegality be revoked along with the visas of their wives, their children and members of their families.”  Although the main entrance of National Assembly was blocked by men of the secret police, PDP lawmakers express fears that the 30 APC lawmakers may be allowed through the entries from the Presidency or Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF) to effect the impeachment. PDP senators who have been barred so far include: Rafiu Ibrahim, Ben Murray-Bruce, Biodun Olujimi, Isah Misau and Shabba Lagiagi. Members of the House of Representatives from PDP also barred include: Mark Gbillah, Tope Olauonu, Razaq Atunwa, Chris Azubogu, Frederick Agbedi among others. Only at the weekend, the federal government appealed to the law makers to reconvene to consider pending national matters including funding for the next election..
