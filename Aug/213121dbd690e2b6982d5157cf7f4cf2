While thousands of APC faithful await the arrival of dignitaries including Godswill Akpabio, former senate minority leader who is defecting about now from the PDP to APC, the crowd seems a far cry from a rally organised last month for him and Governor Udom Emmanuel. Both Akpabio and Udom were of the same political party when members of the PDP in the senatorial district organised a rally in their honour in the Ikot Ekpene township stadium was filled with no space available for people even to squat. But today’s event is slightly different and the traffic  outside the stadium is light with vendors of APC insignia including hand bands and hats making brisk business by displaying their wares for the motley crowd. Outside the stadium also, officials of the Port Harcourt Electricity Distribution Company (PHEDC) collected money from motorists to allow them park their cars and buses in their premises without any hesitation. As at the time of this report, the dignitaries who are expected to witness the defection of the former senate minority leader have yet to arrive the venue of the defection party with music blaring from loud speakers at the background.
