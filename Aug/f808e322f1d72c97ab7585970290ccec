The Premier League transfer window for 2018 that opened in June closed on Thursday August 9th. Clubs were busy strengthening their squads ahead of the 2018/19 Season that gets underway on Friday August 10th with huge sums of money being spent. A total of £1.24 billion have been spent so far compared to the record fee of £1.47 billion during the 2017 summer transfer window. Jose Mourinho looks to have missed out on a new centre back with no positive transfer news coming from Manchester United yesterday. Tottenham have also missed out on bringing any additional players to White Hart Lane this summer. Premier League teams are counting the cost of their summer transfer window spending, with just not enough time to part with more cash before the deadline passes. But while big fees have been paid out, many clubs have recouped large fees for their stars, making their overall net spend appear very healthy. Liverpool and Chelsea are among the biggest net spenders, while West Ham and Fulham have shelled out hefty fees on big statement signings this summer. Meanwhile, Manchester United boss Jose Mourinho is frustrated with a lack of signings, as the board has refused to splash money to reinforce the squad. Rafael Benitez has bemoaned Newcastle’s profit-making business. Liverpool have splashed the most cash in this season summer transfer window after spending £167.9m on four top quality signings to reinforce the Reds’ title charge. The arrivals of Naby Keita, Fabinho, and most recently Xherdan Shaqiri, have seen the Reds spend over £100m already. There are one or two surprises in the list, with West Ham the Premier League’s second-highest spenders so far and Tottenham yet to do any business at all. Chelsea on Wednesday, August 8th signed Kepa for a record fee of £71.6m for a goalkeeper. Tottenham have become the first Premier League side in history to make no signings in a summer transfer window since it was introduced in 2003. Managers have to work with the players until January 2019, but having the window close so early compared to previous seasons means European clubs now have the opportunity to court Premier League talent without the threat of their own players going the other way until the end of August. Premier League clubs spent a record £1.47billion during the 2017 summer transfer window as the total expenditure surpassed 2016 record, when the £1billion threshold was smashed for the first time, by almost £300m. Manchester City splashed the most cash in 2017 summer, with an outlay of £217.3m – primarily on defensive signings Kyle Walker (£50m), Benjamin Mendy (£49.2m), Danilo (£26.9m) and goalkeeper Ederson (£34.7m) – in addition to midfielders Bernardo Silva (£43m) and Douglas Luiz (£10m). Below are list of top ten Premier League teams ranked by net spend during the 2018/19 summer transfer window. Liverpool – £155.4m (spent £167.9m, received £12.5m) Chelsea – £87.3m (spent £128.6m, received £41.3m) West Ham – £82.3m (spent £94.9m, received £12.5m) Fulham – £68m (spent £72m, received £4.1m) Arsenal – £64.8m (spent £68.3m, received £3.5m) Wolves – £64.1m (spent £69.8m, received £5.7m) Manchester United – £51.6m (spent £70.9m, received £19.3m) Brighton – £49.6m (spent £57.1m, received £7.5m) Southampton – £44.5m (spent £54.5m, received £10m) Everton – £33.4m (spent £53.6m, received £20.3m)   Anthony Nlebem
