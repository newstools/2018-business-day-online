The Nigerian bourse extended the prior week’s bearish momentum amid a lack of bullish triggers. Thus, the NSE-ASI ended 4 of the 5 trading days of the week in red territory as year-to-date (YtD) return touched 9.3percent as at Thursday before closing the week at 7.8percent. Despite the last gasp rebound recorded on the last trading day, the NSE-ASI fell by 0.5percent week-on-week (w/w) to 35,266.3 points while market capitalization shrank to N12.9trillion as investors lost a further N66.3billion. Activity levels improved as average volume and value traded were up 23.9percent w/w and 50.5percent w/w to 229.3mn units and N2.5billion respectively. Sectoral performance was overly bearish as 4 the 5 sectors we track, declined w/w. The Industrial Goods (+1.3percent) Index was the week’s lone gainer, consequent on increased buying interest for DANGCEM (+2.8percent) in the later part of the week. On the other hand, the Financial Services (-7.4percent); Bank (-3.8percent) and Insurance (-3.6percent) Indices, bore the brunt of the sell-off during the week, owing to w/w losses recorded by UBA (-11.6percent), ACCESS (-4percent), ZENITH (-3.2percent), GUARANTY (-2.6percent), AIICO (-4.2percent) and NEM (-3.4percent). Similarly, sell-off in OANDO (-11.7percent) and NESTLE (-3.9percent) dragged both the Oil & Gas (-1.5percent) and Consumer Goods (-1.1percent) Indices lower w/w. Investors’ sentiment was underwhelming as market breadth closed the week at 0.3x (previously 0.4x); 13 stocks advanced while 45 declined w/w. This week, we expect the market to remain largely downbeat due to a continued absence of bullish triggers. Also, we expect investors to take profit during early trades ahead of the holiday. Money Market: Rates hover around single-digit on CBN’s passiveness Compared to the preceding week, there was a slight squeeze in system liquidity as rates averaged 9.7percent (Previous week: 8.3percent) on the backdrop of bills funded by authorized dealers at the weekly wholesale FX sales interventions. Elsewhere, the CBN allowed a net repayment of N286.5bn OMO bills – selling only N153.5billion of OMO bills against N440.0bn maturities. Consequently, this trajectory braced liquidity levels. The CBN set out to sell a total of N450.0bn at the OMO auction across two maturities, nonetheless, demand was extremely underwhelming at 0.3x. The 91- & 203-day bills on offer were closed out at stop rates of 11.05percent and 12.15percent respectively. Looking into the new week, a sizeable maturity to the tune of N364.3billion is expected to hit the system and we do not expect any aggressiveness from the CBN in curbing any excesses, given that OMO rates have remained stable at an average of 11.6percent since May-18. Consequently, rates are expected to hover close to prevailing levels – barring any other significant liquidity event. Yields: Offshore risk-off sentiment pushes bond yields to a YTD high of 14.6percent In the T-Bills market, the bearish theme of the week was guided by sell-off by offshore clients, as well as liquidity sentiments following the week’s liquidity straining activities; OMO auction, Bond auction, NTB auction and provisioning for CBN’s retail FX auction by banks. Consequently, average T-bill yield inched higher by 30bps w/w to close the week at 12.8percent. (91-day (up 6bps to 11.6percent), 182-day (up 26bps to 13.3percent) and the 364-day (up 58bps to 13.4percent). Elsewhere, the apex bank conducted its bi-monthly Nigerian Treasury Bill (NTB) auction, wherein it successfully re-financed N33.4bn. Demand was modest with a bid-to-cover ratio of 1.5x compared to 1.3x in the previous auction. Notably, the 364-day tenor was mostly demanded (with a bid-cover of 1.8x compared to 1.0x at the 91-day and 182-day tenors apiece). The auction was carried out at the following stop rates: 91-day (10percent vs. 10percent at the last auction), 182-day (10.4percent vs. 10.4percent at the last auction) and 364-day (11.2percent versus 11.3percent at the last auction). The general risk-off sentiment for Emerging Market assets that was spurred by Turkey’s turmoil saw further off-shore sell-off in the Nigerian bond market. As such, average bond yield edged higher by 46bps to end at a YTD high of 14.6percent. Also, the Debt Management Office (DMO) conducted its monthly auction of FGN bonds for August. The monetary authority initially set out to raise a total of N90billion but was only able to successfully fill 44.1percent of its offer due to an underwhelming demand and an unwillingness of the monetary authority to take up aggressive bids. Thus, the auction was carried out at the following marginal rates: 5-year (14.39percent versus 13.69percent at the last auction), 7-year (14.60percent versus 14percent at the last auction) and 10-year (14.69percent versus 14.30percent at the last auction) – Notably, this represents the fifth consecutive monthly increase in stop rates at the bond auction. Looking forward, we expect the play of political tensions in the local market and risk-off sentiments from foreign players (considering Turkey’s turmoil, a stronger dollar and policy normalization in advanced economies) to weigh on sentiments in the fixed income market. Though, we may still see pockets of demand given that yields are relatively attractive. Foreign Exchange: Movement across FX windows remain muted In the Foreign exchange market, the naira continued to experience stability as movements across FX windows remained soft. The parallel market saw modest naira appreciation by 14bps to settle at N358.5/$1, while the Interbank and Investors & Exporter’s FX windows saw naira depreciation by 3bps and 14bps respectively to finish at N306.1/$1 and N362.5/$1. Looking ahead, the outlook of the naira is expected to remain tied to the spate of CBN’s intervention in the spot and forward market, as well as the better price discovery in the I & E FX window. Global Market Review and Outlook Trade worries impact global stocks In the week that ended 17th of August 2018, three themes shaped the global financial market. First, worries of the financial and currency turmoil in Turkey. Second, the renewed trade talks between the U.S. and China, and finally, strong earnings reports. These factors all took turns in driving daily market moves. In light of the aforementioned, major US equity benchmarks ended the week mixed as continued worries about Turkey weighed, while varying degrees of the news of U.S. and China’s trade talks provided succour for equities. The Dow Jones Industrial Avg. and S&P 500 Indexes were up 1.4percent and 0.6percent w/w while the NASDAQ Composite Index trended southwards by 0.3percent w/w. In Europe, the major equity benchmarks we track were largely bearish amid concerns about the health of Italian banks, Turkey’s currency crisis, and the uncertainty about global trade policies. Overall, Germany’s DAX (-1.7percent) UK’s FTSE (-1.4percent), France’s CAC (-1.3percent), and the Pan European STOXX (-1.2percent) all ended the week in the red territory.
