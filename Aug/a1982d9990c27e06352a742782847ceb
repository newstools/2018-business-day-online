On the 9th of August 2018, the Delegation of German Industry and Commerce in Nigeria (AHK Nigeria), ‘Make-IT in Africa’ (GIZ) and Impact Hub organized an elevator pitch morning to select the finalists for the Start.up! Germany 2018 exposure trip. The exposure trip is a 5-day guided tour to explore Germany’s most vibrant startup hotspots, connect to peers and talent, and most importantly meet potential customers, partners or investors. The 2018 trip focuses on startups in three sectors: Logistics & Mobility, InsurTech and Smart City. Fourteen Nigerian startups were shortlisted from 200 applicants, and invited to pitch and defend their business model to investors. The startups presented their innovative business solutions addressing challenges and opportunities from various sectors. The solutions included smart modular solar grids (Ice Commercial  Company), a platform that enables professionals to access comfortable and affordable shuttles through bus sharing (Shuttlers), a platform  that facilitates domestic and international shipping from a network of courier service providers (SendBox), drone monitoring services to increase efficiency and reduce costs in various sectors (Beatdrone), and affordable data-driven health insurance leveraging mobile phones and telemedicine (RelianceHMO). In addition to selecting the three finalists that will be attending the Start.up! Germany 2018 exposure trip, the aim of the event was to expose the startups to potential investors and foster mutually beneficial business relationships. AHK Nigeria plans to continue sourcing promising innovation for the investor and corporate community. The successful event was held at Impact Hub in Ikoyi and welcomed 35 selected participants which included top local and international investors who are interested in the Nigerian startup ecosystem.
