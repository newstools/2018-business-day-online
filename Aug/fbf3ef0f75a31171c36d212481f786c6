Sadio Mane scored twice as Liverpool started the 2018/19 Premier League with a 4-0 win over West Ham United, their 500th victory in the competition. It was last season’s Golden Boot winner, Mohamed Salah, who opened the scoring 19 minutes in, tapping in from close range after Andrew Robertson’s pass. Mane then slotted into an unguarded net after James Milner hooked the ball into the six-yard box in first-half stoppage time. The Senegalese forward drilled in a third after turning on to Roberto Firmino’s pass soon after the break. Daniel Sturridge then added a fourth late on with his very first touch after replacing Salah as a substitute, turning in from a corner.
