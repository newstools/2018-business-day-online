The United Kingdom (UK) has deployed its expertise to support the growth of innovative solar technology companies to provide clean energy to off-grid households in Africa and improve the lives of over 11 million people while boosting UK business opportunities. UK Minister for Africa Harriett Baldwin, who accompanied the UK Prime Minister, Theresa May, on a state visit to Nigeria on Wednesday, announced that the investment in the sector will reduce some of the challenges being faced by the Africans. This was disclosed in  a statement issued by Senior Communications Officer, Press and Public Affairs Unit of the British High Commission to Nigeria, Atinuoluwake Adelegan on Thursday. Approximately two-thirds of the population across sub-Saharan Africa has no access to electricity and innovative off-grid technology such as such as pay-as-you-go household solar systems, which can provide this much-needed modern energy. This technology according to the statement empowers women by reducing their need to travel for energy, helps children study longer at night, boosts small businesses which can operate more efficiently with reliable power, and reduces the need to use dangerous and polluting fuel sources such as kerosene. “To boost opportunities for businesses in this growing market UK aid, through the Department for International Development, is supporting early stage businesses in Africa to design innovative household solar technologies and break into new markets through the Africa Enterprise Challenge Fund. This programme will help up to 1.5 million poor people in sub-Saharan Africa by 2022 access clean, affordable modern energy, with a focus on women and children,” the statement said. It added that the effort is aimed at using British expertise to help governments break down barriers to the growth of solar companies in Africa and lay the groundwork in 14 partner sub-Saharan African countries which will allow innovative solar companies to grow, increasing access to modern, clean energy for 10 million people The investment is also expected to scale up its support to the Energise Africa impact investment platform, to help 1,500 new UK small investors provide the critical finance needed to connect 125,000 more people to affordable, reliable and clean solar energy.
