In the first quarter of 2018, digital payments contributed 16 percent to MoneyGram revenue, just as total revenue of the firm rose 21 percent, primarily on ack of new customer acquisitions following the successful business expansion into Spain and France. According to World Bank’s Findex report, digital payments are on the rise. Between 2014 and 2017 the share of adults around the world making or receiving digital payments increased by 11 percent, to reach 52 percent; highlighting MoneyGram’s investment into new digital platforms to reach more customers in Sub-Sahara Africa with diaspora remittances. The international payments provider recently announced an expansion of its digital platform to five new countries of Australia, Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands and Portugal. With the expansion, customers in these countries can now send money 24/7 directly to more than two billion bank accounts and mobile wallets or to any MoneyGram location in more than 200 countries and territories. Alex Holmes, chairman/CEO MoneyGram, said the expansion is to provide customers of the brand with more remittance options in an evolving tech-driven world. “Innovative technology is changing the way we meet our customer’s financial needs. In 2018 and beyond, MoneyGram will continue to accelerate our digital expansion around the globe. We want to give MoneyGram customers more choice when they use money transfer services and to ensure we are well positioned to compete in today’s fast-paced world,” said Holmes.
