Chairman of the National Unity Party (NUP) Perry Opara, has declared that a second wave of defection will soon hit the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) stressing that more legislators both at the national and state levels, will abandon President Muhammadu Buhari apparently due to his failure of leadership. Speaking to BusinessDay at the weekend Opara, noted that more governors and even Ministers serving under the Buhari government will dump him for the obvious fact that he allegedly failed to provide inclusive leadership both for the country and the ruling party, saying “nothing will spare Buhari, ministers are going to leave him, the president is not doing well so he has to go” Opara noted that the Coalition of United Political Parties (CUPP), which is a coalition of about 40 political parties including the main opposition People’s Democratic Party (PDP), will present a candidate that will unseat President Buhari and the APC in the 2019 election. On Tuesday, July 24, 14 senators and 37 members of the House of Representatives defected from the APC to PDP. This was later followed by defection of the President of the Senate, Bukola Saraki, Governor Waziri Tambuwal of Sokoto State, Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue state, Governor AbdulFatah Ahmed of Kwara state, National Publicity Secretary of the APC, Bolaji Abdullahi and Nigeria’s High Commissioner to South Africa, Ahmed Ibeto. But reacting of the gale of defection the APC through its National Chairman, Adams Oshiomhole, said that the party is not losing sleep over the matter adding that party is further reassured of the victory of President Muhammadu Buhari in in 2019.
