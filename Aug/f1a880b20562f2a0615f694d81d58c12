The Head Coach of MFM FC, Fidelis Ilechukwu, said the Falconets have the capabilities to advance to the quarter-finals at the on-going FIFA Under-20 Women’s World Cup in France. Ilechukwu added that national U-20 women football team’s players have the skills, determination and focus to crush opponents. He said the team was truly playing as a team as expected, and this was the key to any good team achieving success. “I have total confidence in the technical ability of the team’s head coach, Chris Danjuma, because he is a good team blender. “The girls are really playing well as expected, in spite of losing to Germany in their first game, which was a mistake,” Ilechukwu said. The coach said he was confident the team was “quarter finals-bound’’, in view of their resilience and excellent performance against Haiti. “The girls are focused and determined to win and it is there for everybody to see.’’ The Falconets on Thursday defeated Haiti 1-0 in their second Group D match through Rasheedat Ajibade’s 36th minute penalty kick and will play their final Group D match on Monday against China PR in Dinan-Lehon. China PR lost their first game 2-0  to Germany.  Anthony Nlebem
