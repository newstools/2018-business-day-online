First City Monument Bank (FCMB) Plc in its recently released half year results for the period ended June 2018 showed improvements in profitability, digital banking, and key ratios. The lender’s risk management strategy has paid off as its cost of risk dropped, thanks to improved recovery and collection across sectors FCMB’s growing portfolio of digital banking services is responsible for the increase in transaction commission. Its digital banking service is expected to contribute to future profit. This means shareholders will be rewarded in form of dividend payment. The lender saw a 1,572 percent y-o-y surge in mobile banking enrolment in the period under review. There were N7.6 billion monthly mobile banking transactions in the second quarter of 2018 as per 1.76 million transaction count. Mobile banking income increased by 94 percent to N416 million in June 2018 from 214 million the previous year. FCMB plans to extend its digital lending platform to capture new (non-FCMB) customers in the third quarter of 2018, and it also intends to launch its Digital Savings & Investment Platform in the third quarter. With an upsurge in profit this quarter, it is expected that the bank will finish the year with strong earnings given the relative liquidity in the foreign exchange market since the central bank introduced the Importers’ and Exports (I and E)  window last year.

FCMB’s interest income increased by 3.14 percent to N64.31 billion in June 2018 as against N62.35 billion the previous year, spurred  by a 147.63 percent surge in investment in government other securities classified as held  for sale and 179.56 percent surge in cash and cash equivalent. On the other hand, interest expense fell by 2.71 percent to N29.04 billion in the period under review from N29.85 percent the previous year as a result of the combination of a reduction in deposit from bank to N95.91 billion in the period under review and a reduction in borrowings to N4.0 billion from N5.81 billion the previous year.

The growth in profit was largely driven by an increase in operating profit and a reduction in impairment charge that helped offset the increase total operating expense. Total operating expenses were up 17.90 percent to N37.36 billion in the period under review from N31.70 billion the previous year; driven mainly by an increase in Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria charge (AMCON) and other expenses on alternate channels development.

Increase in balance sheet validates good asset quality FCMB’s total asset increased by 4.40 percent to N1.22 trillion in June 2018 from N1.17 trillion as at June 2017. The growth in assets was amid a sluggish financial intermediation that saw loans and advances dip by 9.70 percent to N585.98 billion in June 2018 from N649.20 billion the previous year. Total liabilities increased by 7.32 percent to N1.05 trillion in June 2018 from N997.21 billion the previous year. The growth in liabilities was driven by a 12.17 percent increase in deposit to N721.28 billion in the period under review from N633.47 billion the previous year. Notable growth in performacne ratio FCMB has utilized the resources of its owners in generating higher profit as return on average equity (ROAE) increased to 6.3 percent in June 2018 from 3.40 percent the previous year. Similarly, return on average asset (ROAA) increase to 1.0 percent in June 2018 from 0.5 percent as at June 2017. Net interest margin (NIM) moved to 8 percent in June 2018 from 7.60 in 2017 as at June 2017. The uptick in NIM can be attributed to growth in interest and non interest income as the lender continues to intensify its digital banking strategy with a view to magnifying shareholders’ earnings. Cost of risk improves to 1.80 percent in the period under review as against 2.80 percent the previous, thanks to risk asset quality, recoveries and impact of IFRS 9 first adoption Investment banking division profit surges 3571 percent Investment Banking profit before tax surged by 3571 percent to N273 million in June 2018 from N7 million the previous year, largely driven by CSL Stock broker Limited.
