If you haven’t seen the recently released annual report of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) for the period ended December 31, 2017, especially with regard to the values of the nation’s non-oil export revenues on one hand, and the amount each of the top 100 exporters made as earnings during the same period, you might not understand the rationale behind this question. The CBN reported improvement in the nation’s non-oil export earnings as at the end of 2017 but the share of non-oil exports relative to GDP is declining. It is on record that in the last two years the CBN had devalued the naira with a view to addressing the pressures in the foreign exchange market. The policy was also meant to make Nigeria’s goods competitive at the international market. “Non-oil revenue (gross), at N3, 207.9 billion, or 2.5 per cent of GDP, accounted for 43.8 per cent of total revenue, indicating a 9.8 per cent increase above the level in 2016. The rise in non-oil revenue reflected improvement in economic activities in the non-oil sector, and the expansion of the tax base. A breakdown of non-oil revenue (gross) indicated that corporate tax (CT), VAT and customs/excise duties rose by 22.0, 19.3 and 14.4 per cent to N1,206.3 billion, N967.7 billion and N628.0 billion, respectively”, the CBN said in its 2017 annual report released recently. In 2013, the share of non-oil revenue relative to GDP stood at 3.5 percent as against 8.4 percent for oil revenue. It was 3.4 percent for non-oil revenue in 2014 compared with 7.5 percent for oil revenue in the same year. The share of the non-oil revenue to GDP further declined to 3.1 percent in 2015; 2.7 percent in 2016 and 2.5 percent in 2017. Furthermore, Nigeria’s non-oil export revenues of the top 100 non-oil exporters remained flat at the end of last year. The top 100 non-oil exporters earned $909.45 million in FY 2017 compared with $910 million in FY 2016. Non-oil export earnings in 2017 were 36 percent lower than $1.43 billion recorded in 2015. Why is Nigeria earning less now that our currency has been devalued? The official exchange rate changed from N167.5/$ in January 2015 to $196.47/$ which lasted from February 2015 to that year’s end. That left us with an average official exchange rate of N192.66/$ in 2015. In 2016, the rate moved from N196.47/$ to N283.75/$ before it settled at N305/$. In effect, the average official exchange rate for 2016 was N252.69/$. Throughout 2017, the official exchange rate remained stable at N305.45/$. This technically means that non-oil exports were cheaper in 2016 when compared with their prices in 2015 and even cheaper in 2017 as against their prices in the previous two years. On the contrary, non-oil exporters made the most earnings in 2015 compared with 2016 and 2017. Shuaib Idris, managing director and chief executive officer of Timeline Consult Limited, attributed the declining share of non-oil export share of the GDP to rebasing of the economy and the non implementation of export expansion grant scheme (EEG). “The prices of our major non-oil export produce have been relatively stable at the international market for the past 2 to 3 years. When I say stable, doesn’t necessarily mean that the prices have remained at the same level. But a plus and minus 10 percent is still acceptable. When you look at it, the economy was rebased which raised our GDP by about 100 percent and that was through financial engineering and not through expansion in productive activities, therefore, the decline in the share of non-oil export relative to GDP was because the rate of growth of non-oil export was not as much as the economy expanded when we rebased”, Idris said. He advised the federal government to implement the EEG scheme which it has abandoned for a while. “Government needs to start implementing the EEG scheme, as it has the potential to improve the non-oil export”, he added Another interesting trend emerging from the records of the top 100 non-oil exports is that Olam Nigeria, Nigeria’s number one non-oil exporter, has lost its position. Olam Nigeria exported $143.86 million worth of goods as it accounted for 10 percent of the nation’s non-oil export earnings in 2015. Its exports fell by 23 percent to $110.89 million in 2016 even when it accounted for 12 percent of the nation’s non oil export earnings in that year. Still on the 2015 non-oil exporters’ list, Bolawole Enterprises sold $90.96 million worth of goods to be number 2. The British American Tobaco (BAT) exported $80.59 million as number 3 while AIS Traders and Industries, as well as Saro Agro Allied sold each sold $40.80 million as number 4 and 5 respectively. In 2016, BAT sold $145.48 million goods overseas, and the firm emerged as the number 1 non-oil exporter. Others among the top five are Olam Nigeria, $110.89 million; Indorama Eleme Fertilizers, $69.81 million; Atlantic Shrimpers, $38.40 million and Olatunde International, $8.17 million. The British American Tobacco dominated the table of the top 100 non-oil exporters in 2017, with $145.48 million in earnings, accounting for 16 percent of the total non-oil exports. It was followed by Olam Nigeria, $110.89 million; Indorama Eleme Fertilizers, $69.81 million; Atlantic Shrimpers, $38.40 million, and Tulip Cocoa Processing, $32.60 million. “Nigeria seems not to be benefiting from devaluation as most of the transactions are channelled through the informal sector, which means the informal sector is growing supported by smuggling activities. It is only when the government does the right thing that exporters will begin to channel their earnings through the formal sector”, a senior analyst who wanted anonymity said. The large arbitrage opportunity between the official exchange rate of $306/$ and N366/$ at the parallel market has been fingered as a major factor. In 2017, most of the nation’s non-oil exporters sold goods to customers in Liberia, Guinea, Ghana, Cameroun, Cote D’Ivoire, Niger, Sierra Leone, Togo and Ethiopia among others. “The gap between the official exchange rate and parallel rate is tempting and should be addressed to bring more transactions into the formal sector”, one of our contacts said. In the last quarter of 2017, trade with countries on the African continent accounted for 2.1 percent of Nigeria’s exported agricultural goods; 7.7 percent of raw materials exports; 34 percent of solid minerals exports; 98 percent of energy goods exports; 45 percent of manufactured exports, and 6.1 percent of other oil non oil exports.
