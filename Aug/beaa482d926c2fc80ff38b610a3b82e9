Doyin Coker, Head of Youth Banking spoke on the International Youth Day theme saying, “Individuals can create safe spaces in their personal relationships with each other by inclusiveness and respect for everyone’s opinions. This will help to enhance peaceful co-existence and also attract the development we seek as individuals. We have a responsibility to create safe spaces for each other even as we search for our own safe spaces.” Students and other participants at the event left with a deeper knowledge on the benefit of creating public, digital, and civic spaces to promote innovation and development.
