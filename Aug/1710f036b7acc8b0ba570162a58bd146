Some analysts did not rule out the impact of rising uncertainty ahead of Nigeria’s 2019 general election on equities trading activities and the decisions of foreign investors to repatriate their matured fixed income investments due to low yields. “Due to a strengthening US dollar, higher US interest rates, and treasury yields, naira assets began to experience marked pressure by Q2-18. Despite political concerns, we believe risk-off sentiment may be exaggerated given that economic fundamentals in Nigeria remain broadly supportive”, the analysts said in their recent daily insight “how intense will the foreign bears be in H2-18?”, according to Kayode Tinuoye-led team of research analysts at Lagos-based United Capital Plc. Though, the decline seen in trading activities in second-quarter runs contrary to record great flows in 2017 and first-quarter (Q1) of 2018, but the research analysts at United Capital still expect a continued flight from equity to fixed income investments “as coping strategies for higher volatility in the financial market”.

Recent reversal in stocks’ downward trend can be attributed to bargain hunting investors who are taking advantage of lower prices as well as those investors who are strategically positioning ahead of more first-half (H1) 2018 results and the relative stability seen in the economic environment.

The signal of possible trade wars between the US and China might have had a negative impact on the global equity markets”, FSDH Research analysts noted in their monthly strategic report. They noted that the performance of the equity market between July and June in the last five years shows that the market recorded negative performances in 2014, 2015 and 2016; while it appreciated in 2013 and 2017. “Despite the fact that the equity market recorded more losses than gains in the last five years, the equity market is showing signs of recovery. We expect the equity market to appreciate from the current levels as investors take position in the market ahead of the release of HY1 2018 results,” FSDH research analysts said.
