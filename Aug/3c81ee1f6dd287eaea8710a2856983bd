Super Eagles forward Ahmed Musa has dumped English Premier League side Leicester City for a Saudi Arabian outfit Al-Nassr for an undisclosed fee, the club announced. Musa was  Leicester’s record signing when he joined for £16m from Russian side CSKA Moscow in 2016. But after just two goals in 21 games, the 25 years old was loaned back to CSKA Moscow last season. Musa featured for Nigeria at the recent World Cup finals in Russia, scoring both goals in a win over Iceland.
