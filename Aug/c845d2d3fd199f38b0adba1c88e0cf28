Swedish city authorities have advised girls travelling in Gothenburg to tuck a spoon in their underwear if they fear being taken abroad for forced marriage or female genital mutilation (FGM). This is because; girls putting a spoon in their underwear will raise the alarm in Gothenburg Airport. The idea comes from British charity Karma Nirvana, which said the tactic had already saved a number of girls in Britain from forced marriage, and it is expected that activists in other cities will encourage the adoption of the spoon initiative to protect girls. The spoon-in-the-underwear tactic is being used as a last-ditch effort to save girls from forced marriage. The Gothenburg Airport staff at Sweden’s second-largest city has been told how to respond in such circumstances. ‘The spoon will trigger metal detectors when you go through security checks,’ ‘You will be taken aside and you can then talk to staff in private.’ said Katarina Idegard, who tackles honour-based violence there. Airport staff in Gothenburg have been trained to respond if the alarm is raised. “It is a last chance to sound the alarm,’ Idegard added. The charity said hiding a spoon in their underwear was a safe way for girls to alert the authorities which can be difficult if they were surrounded by family. Forced marriage and FGM are illegal in Sweden, even if carried out abroad, and punishable by prison terms.  Desmond Okon
