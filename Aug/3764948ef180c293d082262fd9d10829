The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) said on Wednesday that the Presidency and the All Progressives Congress (APC) have become confused and overburdened by guilt, following the barrage of national and international indignation against them over their failed attempt to illegally takeover the National Assembly on Tuesday. The PDP said with the failure of the Presidency and the APC to sway the public with the sack of the Director General of the DSS, Lawal Daura, they have become schizophrenic in their bid to politicize the invasion, while further exposing their culpability in the sordid act. A statement released by the PDP national publicity secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, said that “the APC jaundiced reasoning and penchant for deceit know no bound. “Is it not schizophrenic for the APC, in its statement, a day after the invasion, to accuse Senate President Bukola Saraki of triggering security issues at the National Assembly, when the Presidency had already ‘found’ DSS Director General wanting and summarily sacked him for the invasion? “How can the APC accuse Senate President Saraki of causing security concerns by ‘reconvening’ the National Assembly, when it is public knowledge that the National Assembly has not been reconvened despite the pressure by the factional National Chairman of the APC, Mr. Adams Oshiomhole, the Special Adviser to the Presidential on National Assembly Matters, Senator Ita Enang and Senator Ahmed Lawan on the leadership of the Senate to reconvene?” The PDP said that “The APC, in its statement has finally vindicated our position regarding its plans to stampede the Senate President to reopen the National Assembly wherein it will unleash thugs and security agencies to trigger violence, overwhelm the legislature and forcefully takeover the leadership of the Senate. “Nigerians are now clear on the fact that the invasion was carefully planned by the APC and the Presidency and that they would have succeeded but for the resistance mounted by our lawmakers, Nigerians and the media, who stood in defence of democracy. “We invite Nigerians to note that in its attempt to politicize the invasion and provide cover for the culprits in the Presidency and the APC, the APC has ended up exposing their sinister plots and culpability” The PDP insisted on an independent panel of enquiry to be headed by a retired Chief Justice of Nigeria to investigate the remote and immediate cause of the assault while all culprits, no matter how highly placed, must be made to face the wrath of the law.
