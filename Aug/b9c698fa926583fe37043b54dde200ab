1. It Revivifies you: Florals are pleasant and colourful. If you have quite a number of plain coloured outfits perhaps a burst of colours this season will spice up your wardrobe. As a gown, long or short, it can be worn for events including dinners, weddings, beach parties to mention a few. 2, Tone it down:  Interestingly, same way you can use florals to spark up your wardrobe, you can also use it to tone down your outfit for instance, you can use your plain jacket on a long sleeveless floral gown and still look smashing! 3, Size: Depending on your size, the use of floral designs can be to your advantage or disadvantage. For instance, a large floral pattern can overpower a petite lady while a small pattern may not necessarily be okay for a lady with a bigger feature. It is important to find your balance. Observe the fabric for what area that is more projected. This can be done by placing the fabric on your body. You will find it easier to make your decision on the fabric whether to use or not to use after this. 4, Elegant Pants: Floral pants are beautiful, especially when you combine them with a plain version of any colour you choose from the fabric. 5, Sides:  Be it floral shoes, bags, clutch bag, scarfs and so on, each one has a way of adding an edge to your outfit if matched perfectly.
