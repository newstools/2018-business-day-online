Barcelona have a strong Latin American representation for the 2018/19 season after a busy summer transfer window has added to those already in place at the Camp Nou. Arturo Vidal’s signing made him the latest to arrive and the eighth now in Ernesto Valverde‘s squad, although Yerry Mina is still expected to leave to bring that number down to seven. Three South American players that have arrived this summer are Arthur, Malcomand Vidal. Also this year, Philippe Coutinho arrived in January from Liverpool to join Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Rafinha who were already at the Camp Nou, though the latter was on loan at Inter last term. Together, they form a luxury attack for Valverde and, Ousmane Dembele aside, the offensive side of the team is almost exclusively South American. In addition to Messi and Suarez, Malcom and Coutinho pose a serious goal threat, with both willing and able to cut in from their respective flanks and unleash a shot.  Source: Marca
