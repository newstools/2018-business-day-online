Former governor of Kogi State, Ibrahim Idris, has said that brighter future awaits the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) in the 2019 general election, saying that the failure of the present administration to bring smiles to the electorate informed his optimism. Idris stated this when spoke with newsmen in Lokoja, saying he hoped by the grace of God PDP was going to redeem the position looking at what is happening since the inception of the present administration. “As far as I am concerned, there is a brighter future and I hope by God’s grace we will get there. We are going to redeem the position from what is happening. When you have two wives and you have tasted their soups at least you will be able to know which of the wives tastes better,” he said. Idris maintained that from his observations people are going to vote their conscience. On the issue of vote-buying, Idris said: “Naturally, it will happen and even if it happens, people know exactly what they want. They have tasted the two parties.”  Victoria Nnakaike, Lokoja
