Liverpool have turned down a whooping £2 billion bid from cousin of Manchester City owner Sheik Mansour, according to a report by the Daily Mail. There were several meetings over a six month period that ran into this year with Khaled Bin Zayed Al Nehayan, that would also have seen a Chinese investor take a minority share at Liverpool. Although this bid was unsuccessful, Liverpool are believed to be looking for investors to put money into the club so as to help them compete with the richest sides in Europe. A  successful £2billion takeover would have been a world record for the most expensive in the history of football. Khaled is one of the most successful entrepreneurs in the Middle East, the report added. His managing director Midhat Kidwai also met with Liverpool chairman Tom Werner in New York. Fenway Sports Group purchased Liverpool for £280million in 2010.  Anthony Nlebem
