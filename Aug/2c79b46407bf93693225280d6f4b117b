The World football governing body, FIFA, on Monday 20 August, 2018 suspended its planned ban of Nigeria from participating in its football activities, recognising Amaju Pinnick-led Nigeria Football Federation(NFF) board. “FIFA received confirmations that the legitimate leadership of the NFF under President Amaju Melvin Pinnick and General Secretary Mohammed Sanusi has been given back effective control of the NFF and its offices. “In view of these circumstances, FIFA deems that the conditions set by the decision of the Bureau of the FIFA Council have now been met and consequently the suspension of the NFF will not take effect,” a statement from FIFA website reads. FIFA also confirmed that it would continue to closely monitor the situation in order to ensure that FIFA’s rules and regulations are fully adhered to. The Federal Government on Monday 20th August issued statement recognising the Amaju Pinnick led Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) board as the legitimate and recognised board. This is according to a Twitter message by Laolu Akande, the Senior Special Assistant to the Vice President. “The FG has already conveyed to FIFA its firm position recognizing Amaju Pinnick-led NFF as the current & only NFF Exco. Govt will also continue to work with all relevant stakeholders involved to resolve dispute in a timely manner.” ”FG is upholding NFF treaty obligations to FIFA” FIFA had on August 14 threatened to ban Nigeria from all football competitions if its offices are not handed over back to the rightful executives by 12:00 on Monday. Before now, the Chris Giwa faction of Nigeria Football Federation had occupied the NFF Glass House. Football stakeholders hope this will finally put to end the lingering crisis rocking Nigeria football. Anthony Nlebem & Tony Ailemen, Abuja
