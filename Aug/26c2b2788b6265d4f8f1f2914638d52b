Quidax, a European-based firm, is launching its digital assets exchange platform that offers Nigerian investors the opportunity to buy and sell about six cryptocurrencies. A statement released by the company and sent to BusinessDay disclosed that the new platform will guarantee a simple, secure and seamless interface that allows users trade in cryptocurrencies. In the next three months, users will be able to trade more than twenty digital currencies on one platform. This automatically makes the Quidax platform the largest cryptocurrency platform in Africa. Quidax which was established in 2016 will initially allow users trade digital currencies like Ripple, Litecoin, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Gold, and Bitcoin Cash before expanding the offerings to twenty. Buchi Okoro, the company’s CEO said it has a firm grasp of the problems that threatens the global financial landscape and it is on a mission to “challenge the status quo, to push humanity forward and thus, the exchange is a step towards our goal of breaking down financial barriers and increasing opportunities to wealth creation.” As part of strategies to deepen its unique proposition, Quidax plans to invest heavily on blockchain and cryptocurrency education to increase the level of understanding in Nigeria, something it said is lacking today. “Unlike most exchange platforms, Quidax take away the teium of running between minimised phone apps while transacting and offers users a buffet of assets to buy and sell,” the statement noted. The all-in-one benefit of the platform has seen users trooping en masse to sign up for trades on the Quidax platform.
