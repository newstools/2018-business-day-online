U.S. Senator John McCain, a former prisoner of war in Vietnam who ran unsuccessfully for president in 2008 as a self-styled maverick Republican and became a prominent critic of President Donald Trump, died on Saturday at age 81. According to a monitored Reuters report, the senator for Arizona for more than three decades, McCain, had been suffering from glioblastoma, a brain cancer, since July 2017 and had not been at the U.S. Capitol this year. His family announced on Friday that McCain was discontinuing further cancer treatment. He died on Saturday afternoon with his wife Cindy and other family members at his bedside. “At his death, he had served the United States of America faithfully for sixty years,” said a statement from his office. McCain will lie in state in both Phoenix, Arizona, and in the Capitol Rotunda in Washington, D.C., and will receive a full dress funeral service at the Washington National Cathedral before being buried in Annapolis, Maryland, his family said. McCain was born on Aug. 29, 1936, at an American naval installation in the Panama Canal Zone – U.S. territory at the time – where his father was stationed. He acknowledged he was a “smart ass” during his years at the U.S. Naval Academy and graduated fifth from the bottom of his class. McCain divorced his wife Carol after 15 years of marriage in 1980 and weeks later married the former Cindy Henley, daughter of a wealthy beer distributor in Arizona. In a tweet Sunday morning Cindy paid tribute to her late husband writing “My heart is broken. I am so lucky to have lived the adventure of loving this incredible man for 38 years. He passed the way he lived, on his own terms, surrounded by the people he loved, in the place he loved best.”
