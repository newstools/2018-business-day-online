Former president Olusegun Obasanjo has lavished praise on former governor of Jigawa State Sule Lamido who is seeking to be president under the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Lamido visited former president as part of his consultation with prominent Nigerian persons and institutions including Olusegun Obasanjo whom he met at presidential Library in Abeokuta. It was Lamido’s second visit to Obasanjo, after an earlier call on the former president last year and the visit comes days after Obasanjo publicly announced he would not be supporting Abubakar Atiku, another PDP presidential hopeful. The account of the visit is contained in social media post by Lamido’s aide, Mansur Ahmed, who said the visit “was part of the consultation with relevant stakeholders, elders, party officials and key political actors in Nigeria.” According to the post, Lamido had said to the former president, “I have nothing to tell you about me because you know me more than anybody. I came to greet you, brief you, seek for your blessings and ask for your fatherly advise.” Responding, Obasanjo remarked, “as a former Minister of Foreign Affairs, Sule knows the world and knows how to relate with other countries. I was so happy and elated by what I saw in Jigawa state when you became a governor.” He added, “Sule I don’t have any doubt about your attributes, your capacity, your courage, your interest about your state and Nigeria at large. Sule, you can do it and you can do it well.” Lamido has made similar visits to the former military heads of state Abdulsalami Abubakar and Ibrahim Babangida. Lamido has also earlier met with all the PDP state governors in their respective states, the 36 PDP state chairmen, including zonal vice chairmen of the party and former speakers forum.
