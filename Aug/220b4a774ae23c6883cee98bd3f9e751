The changing nature of work in the 21st century is one of the most important concerns of the day, especially with the rising cost of living and population in a rapidly urbanising megacity like Lagos. In this vein, the Lagos State Employment Trust Fund (LSETF) in collaboration with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), introduced the Employability Support Project to improve the pool of skilled and employable manpower in Lagos and alleviate the acute shortage of employable labour in the construction, manufacturing, healthcare, hospitality, entertainment and garment-making sectors. The free vocational training provides free four to eight-week vocational training to Lagos residents who are either unemployed or underemployed and also works towards placing successful trainees in jobs after training. Already, a good number of trainees have been placed in jobs and large organisations have indicated interest in hiring trained and certified candidates from the programme. Since August 8, representatives of LSETF have been going on a tour of radio stations and communities to educate them about the importance of vocational skills in giving young and vulnerable youths a fighting chance as well as to inform employers about the benefits of recruiting their workforce from the Project’s database of trained and certified workers. This will end on August 19. The team holds community engagement activities at the Isheri Olowora, Ojodu Berger, Agric-Ikorodu and Lagos Island between the 10th to 19th of August, 2018.  Odinaka Anudu
