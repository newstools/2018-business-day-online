Law Union & Rock Insurance Plc has continued on the trend of improved earnings among publicly traded securities as the company posted half year earnings, which were slightly better than its figures in the half year of 2017. The insurance firm grew its profit after tax for H1 2018 to N364.2 million from N318.7 million in H1 2017, recording a growth of around 14.4 percent. This surge in profit occurred despite low gross premium underwriting growth. Although gross premium underwritten increased marginally from N2.73 billion in H1 2017 to N2.79 billion in H1 2018, net premium income increased significantly by around N200 million from N1.21 billion in H1 2017 to N1.41 billion in H1 2018, a change of around 16 percent. The uptick in net premium income was primarily aided by the significant drop in premiums ceded to reinsurers, which fell from -N947 million to -N731 million. The savings of around N236 million helps explain  a similar increase in net premium income during the first six months of 2018. Investment income also rose significantly from N394.8 million to N488.9 million as total assets increased by around N400 million from N10.03 billion to N10.43 billion. The growth in investment income could be attributed to a rebalancing of the capital allocation of the firm. The company reduced its cash pile from N3 billion in H1 2017 to N2.6 billion in H1 2018 and increased its investment securities holdings from N3.12 billion in H1 2017 to N3.52 billion in H1 2018. Again the change in both cash holdings and security holdings were around N400 million. Law Union & Rock Insurance recently released  more retail products to meet the need of its customers.
