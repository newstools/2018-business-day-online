The ruling All Progressives Congress, APC is fraught with another controversy as the National Working Committee, NWC lifted the suspension slammed on Shehu Sani, representing Kaduna Central District by his ward EXCO. APC NWC directed the chairman of the party in Tudun ward and others to implement the directive with a view to complimenting the peace efforts being made by the national leadership of the party to bring back peace in the party in Kaduna State. Yekini Nabena, APC Acting National Publicity Secretary in statementstated that, “the National Secretariat has received the news of the suspension of Senator Shehu Sani by the Tudun Wada ward Chairman and wish to clarify that the purported suspension of Distinguished Senator Shehu Sani representing Kaduna Central Senatorial District is hereby lifted and is confirmed as a bonafide Member and leader of our party. “The Chairman Kaduna State Chapter has been directed to inform the relevant Ward and Local Government chapters appropriately, and also   put the necessary mechanism towards complementing the efforts of the National leadership towards ensuring lasting peace and unity in the party”. This is coming barely a week after Sani had shunned the idea of defecting to the PDP like other APC National Assembly members following the peace moves initiated by the National chairman of the APC, Adams Oshiomhole.
