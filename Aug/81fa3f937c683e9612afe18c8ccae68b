Rory McIlroy is considering skipping the first event of the FedEx Cup play-offs series in an attempt to find his best form with the Ryder Cup looming. The play-offs begin with the Northern Trust event from 23-26 August while the Ryder Cup is held from 28-30 September. McIlroy, 29, finished 14 shots behind new US PGA champion Brooks Koepka. “I will do some practice this week and see if I feel ready to go there [New Jersey] and play five out of six weeks leading up to the Ryder Cup,” he said.
Now ranked seventh in the world and without a major win in four years, the Northern Irishman admitted there was “a lot of room for improvement” following the final major of the year at Bellerive. “The best thing might be to take that first Fed-Ex Cup week off and come back hopefully in a better place,” he added. “Historically the first Fed-Ex play-off event hasn’t been my best of the four.” The County Down native won the FedEx Cup in 2016 having missed the first event. The final play-off event, the Tour Championship, concludes less than a week before the start of the Ryder Cup in Paris. Thomas Bjorn will captain the European team at Le Golf National.
