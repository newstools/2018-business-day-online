Solomon Ogba, Chairman of the Local Organising Committee (LOC) of the 21st African Senior Athletics championships (ASAC) on Thursday in Asaba blamed participating countries’ contingents for their arrival schedule issues. Ogba, at a press conference, said the contingents had been informed earlier to send in their arrival schedule early but they did not do so until two days to their arrival. A good number of the 52 contingents at the championship had at some time experienced delays in transporting their athletes and officials from Lagos to Asaba, venue of the championship. “It was not entirely the fault of the LOC, concerning the issues experienced here. “Two weeks ago, a Delegate Registration Meeting (DRM) was held and countries were asked to forward their arrival and departure schedules to the LOC. “This information did not get to us till two days before their arrival. “Also, coupled with the fact that we have had terrible weather in the last few weeks, flights were rescheduled without notice and we had two flights cancelled. “But, in the end, we were able to lodge in the hotels all members of the contingents who were in Lagos and fed them as well before they got to Asaba. “At the moment, we have asked all countries to send in details about their departure arrangements with a deadline of today (Thursday). “Otherwise, we will not be held responsible for what happens to them,’’ Ogba said. The former president of Athletics Federation of Nigeria (AFN) however apologised for the hiccups and promised better experience as the competition progresses. The championships began on Wednesday and will end on Sunday.
