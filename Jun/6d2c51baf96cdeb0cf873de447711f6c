Adebayo Adelabu, Deputy Governor incharge of Operations at the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has resigned his position to face his political career. The CBN announced on Thursday that President Muhammadu Buhari has formally accepted his disengagement with effect from July 15, 2018.
Though the CBN statement which announced his resignation did not state why the young CBN DG is leaving the exalted office, BusinessDay authoritatively gathered that his disengagement is to allow him pursue his political career.
Adelabu is being tapped as 2019 Oyo State governorship aspirant under the ruling All Progressive Congress (APC).
In a letter dated May 24, 2018 and personally signed by him, President Buhari thanked Adelabu for his services to the country and wished him the best in his future ambitions, according to the statement signed by the CBN Acting Director, Corporate Communications Department, Isaac Okorafor.
“While appreciating your services in the Central Bank of Nigeria since 9th April 2014, I wish you the very best in your future ambitions and continued commitment to public service in our country and specifically, as you seek to play a more active role in politics, in your home State,” the letter stated.
Adelabu formally assumed duty as Deputy Governor at the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) on April 9, 2014 and served at different times as Deputy Governor in charge of Financial System Stability (FSS), Corporate Services (CS), and lastly Operations (Ops), before he tendered his letter of disengagement.
