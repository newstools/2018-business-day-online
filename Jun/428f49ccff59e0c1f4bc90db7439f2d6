Returnees affected by insurgency in Madagali Local Government Area of Adamawa have lauded the Victim Support Fund (VSF) for providing them agricultural inputs for this cropping season. Some of the returnees who spoke to News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Gusau, the headquarters of Madagali local government area commended VSF for the gesture. According to them, the distribution of farm inputs comprising improved varieties of seedlings, fertilizers, pesticides and sprayers to 1, 000 households for the rain-fed farming season, would help many families that were struggling to pick up their lives once again. “I was overwhelmed by this gesture by the VSF. We are known for agriculture and the vital support at this critical time is what we need to stabilize,” Cecilia Bitrus said. Joseph Manga who is one of the beneficiaries lauded VSF for the timely intervention. “They have given us all we needed for a farm; the seeds, insecticide and fertilizer. I am grateful to God, I am grateful to VSF. “I am now praying for steady rainfall as I look forward to bumper harvest this year, ” Manga said. Peter Oju and Simon Joseph also commended VSF for the support and promised maximum utilization of the inputs for maximum result. “We are also excited about the fact that VSF is working with other technical partners like Fadama 111 that would assist us on how to use the inputs for maximum result,” Joseph said. Also speaking, the chairman of Madagali Local Government, Alhaji Yusuf Mohammed thanked VSF for the support and warned beneficiaries against selling the inputs. “This support came at a better time as we are just witnessing planting season here. “I thanked VSF and Mr President for considering us as the gesture will go a long way in boosting our agriculture output and recovery effort. “I must say that Madagali is the most devastated area by insurgency in Adamawa. So  such support in vital areas like agriculture and education by VSF is really giving us a sense of belonging,” Mohammed said.
