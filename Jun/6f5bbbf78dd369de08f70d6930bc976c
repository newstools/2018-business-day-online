It is no news that Skinny Girl in Transit, Ndani’s #1 web series is currently being shot at an unknown location. What is making the news is the new additions to the web series for Season Five. Just knowing that none other than (a bit cliche I agree) Nick Mutuma of ‘This is It’ (Another web series) is joining the Skinny Girl in Transit family has me doing cartwheels in my mind. The scintillating Beverly Naya announced it by posting a picture of the sexy Kenyan in a group picture on her Instagram page. With the lads! #SGIT5 A post shared by  Beverly Naya (@thebeverlynaya) on Jun 26, 2018 at 4:20am PDT  Season five of the Skinny Girl in Transit promises to be interesting. If you have not watched any of it, click here. In case you have not hopped on the Youtube train, let me introduce you. As an honourable member of the generation that spends more time in traffic than at home, I depend on Youtube to keep me entertained. As a digital nomad who is constantly on the move, life is incomplete without a modem. So excess gigabyte means a near heaven experience. I can watch anything I google. Anything on TV is also on the internet and in order not to miss much, I am on the internet 24/7, well almost. Back to ‘Skinny Girl in Transit’, if you were not already in love with Mide and Tiwa last year, watch season 4 here or start at the first season here.
