Many investors at the Lagos Bourse are still afraid to buy more stocks, even as Nigeria’s mucky political climate causes equities prices to downtrend. While market watchers expected the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) to sustain early week’s (Monday) gain, it rather extended loss line on Wednesday as evident in the position of the Bourse’s benchmark index. Amid this scenario, analysts still expect investors to take advantage of existing attractive entry prices in fundamentally sound stocks despite that most stocks in their watch-list for the month of June have fallen off price targets. As increased sell-off on Customs Street pushed equities value down on Wednesday, the market’s year-to-date (ytd) returns furthered negative and closed at -0.73percent. Many asset managers are repositioning their portfolios ahead of the expected second-quarter (Q2)/first half (H1) 2018 results from listed companies.
