iCreate Africa has partnered new organisations for its first ever iCreate Skill Fest.  Some of the organisations supporting the project are: the Federal Ministry of Industry Trade and Investment; Embassy of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, Berlin-Germany; Abuja Chamber of Commerce and Industry; Nigeria Employers’ Consultative Association (NECA), and the Delegation of German Industries and Commerce in Nigeria. These are lending their networks, platforms and expertise within the industry space to help make iCreate Africa Skill Fest a success, according to Teresa Aligbe, public relations director.  Aligbe says the partners share iCreate’s commitment and passion to positively reshape the narrative around vocational skills acquisition, empower Nigerian youths with relevant skills for the job market as well as entrepreneurship, and help solve the biting problem of unemployment in the country.  She adds that international NGOs, Oxfam and Siemens are also their lending support and decades of technical expertise.  “The Start Up and SME scene is duly represented by StartUp Incubator, Impact Hub Lagos and StartUp, Creative and SME focused communications firm, Phenom Communications. A special thanks to our media partners, The Guardian and The Beat 99.9Fm, whose partnership with iCreate Africa, just like all our other partners, is borne out of a shared understanding of the many solutions the vocational skills sector can unlock for the country.” For more information, Partnership or Sponsorship please contact Diana Gideon info@icreateafrica.com or visit our website at www.icreateafrica.com.
