Nigeriaâ€™s securities and Exchange Commission is soon to issue rules for green bonds by a non-sovereign organization according to industry sources.

Data from global bodies estimate that Nigeria could see green bond deals reaching around $1bn in one year with estimates for South Africa topping $1.6bn this year out a total of $200bn worth of green bonds to be issued this year alone. The first green bond was issued in 2012 and since then issuances have exceeded $300bn globally.
