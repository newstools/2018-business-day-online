The Federal Government on Monday summoned the United States of America Ambassador to Nigeria Stuart Symington over President Donald Trump remark about Africans. This came few days after Botswana summoned the US Ambassador in the country over similar issue, with South Africa, El Salvador and African Union equally condemning the remark by President Trump. In a statement signed by Tope Ade Elias-Fatile, Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson, he said the Federal government has already summoned the ambassador to the ministry. It would be recalled that President Trump reportedly referred to African countries as ‘shitholes countries’. According to him, “Further to my previous message about the consideration of options to respond to the remarks by President Trump, I like to quickly inform you that the the Federal Government will be summoning the US Ambassador today (Monday)”.
