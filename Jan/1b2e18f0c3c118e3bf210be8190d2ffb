French president Emmanuel Macron may well earn the distinction of being the only defender of Africa by the time the 2018 annual meetings of the world economic forum ends in Davos.  The youngish French leader who addressed the elite gathering late Wednesday walked into the hall in a standing ovation and was greeted with the same honour when he finished speaking.  Twice Macaron mentioned Africa as he championed the cause of a continent many say as the last frontier of growth in the world but whose leaders could not be counted to defend it.  Leader of the continent’s biggest economies – Nigeria and South Africa –are to be looked upon to be the voice for the continent but both are staying away from Davos this time.  South Africa’s Jacob Zuma is mired at home in a fight for his life after a swirl of corruption allegations and his Nigerian counterpart Muhammadu Buhari has not made a habit of being participating at the kind of gathering holding in Davos.  President of France outlined his agenda to create a more competitive France and address the concerns of many French citizens on globalization. He told participants at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting: “The objective is very simple and straightforward – make France more competitive, more innovative, in order to finance … a fair system.” Macron outlined to participants the five pillars of his reform plan: education, investment and capital, acceleration and flexibility, fighting climate change, and what he called “cultural change”. He pledged €15 billion over the next five years to train and reskill workers. He urged special attention to the education of women, not just in France but globally, noting that women make up two-thirds of the over 750 million people who don’t possess basic literacy skills.
