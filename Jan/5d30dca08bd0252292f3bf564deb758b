European leaders take the stage at the Davos summit Wednesday, jostling to position themselves as a counterweight to US President Donald Trump before his “America First” show rolls into town. French President Emmanuel Macron arrives in the Swiss ski resort fresh from rallying big business bosses on Monday in his drive for a “renaissance” in French and world business, AFP reports. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, on the other hand, needs to settle her own leadership problems before leading the resistance to Trump, who appears on Friday. Merkel was late in confirming that she would attend, tearing herself away from efforts to form a new government back home after an election setback in September. “Merkel doesn’t have a government yet. Macron is the new deal,” one prominent business delegate at Davos, PR company boss Richard Edelman, told AFP. For German economic daily Handelsblatt, Merkel is heading to Davos with her hands “tied”. It said she will be obliged to “stay in the shadow of Macron and Trump”. Macron is riding high, having managed to push through sensitive labour and tax reforms in France. “The time when Merkel could assume that Europe could soldier on under her leadership, but under a very weak leadership in France, is over,” Judy Dempsey of Carnegie Europe, a think tank, wrote in a blog post. “Emmanuel Macron has radically changed the dynamics, the pace, and the ambition of the European Union.” – From Versailles to Davos – At his pre-Davos gathering at the Versailles palace on Monday, the 40-year-old centrist Macron bathed in the attentions of bosses from companies such as Facebook and Google, who announced major investments in France. “He’s the hope. He’s a guy who has built his own party… He has an ambitious reform package,” said Edelman.
