Sule Lamido, a former governor of Jigawa State has said Nigeria had moved from Boko-Haram to hunger-haram under the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in less than three years in office. Lamido also disclosed that the APC was formed in 2015 by those who claimed to love Nigeria more than Nigeria with no clear-cut vision on what to do when they come to power. He alleged that the present leadership of the country was bankrupt with ideas on how to move the country forward and that was why he was offering himself to salvage the country from extinction. The former minister of External Affairs disclosed this when he paid a courtesy visit on Governor Ben Ayade of Cross River State at the state executive Council Chambers to solicit support from the state ahead of the party primaries this year. He described PDP as the party owned by Nigerians with genuine concern for the welfare of all Nigerians irrespective of their tribe or religion as in the case by the ruling party. “Today we witness the collapse of governance because they were not prepared in the first place; they only came together to grab power at the centre without proper planning, that is why today we have ‘hunger-haram’ in the country,” he said. In his remarks, Governor Ayade said the loyalty of the PDP in the state was great and commended the presidential hopeful of his understanding of the state and its people, while wishing him well in his aspiration.
