The APC in a statement issued by its National Publicity Secretary, Bolaji Abdullahi on Monday said it honours the  party to join family, friends, well-wishers and associates in celebrating the retired general who has emerged as a bastion of democracy, good governance and development in Nigeria and beyond. The ruling party said that  “Obasanjo has inspired a generation of Nigerians notably in the area of entrepreneurship, leadership and education, especially through his non-profit initiatives, the Africa Leadership Forum (ALF) and the Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library. “His legacy as President has continued to inspire good governance on the continent even after so many years and he remains an influential voice in different facets of our national life. As a true Nigerian patriot and statesman, Chief Obasanjo has over the years built solid bridges across political divides in the country, on the African continent and the world at large. “Our prayer is that Chief Obasanjo continues to age in health and wisdom as he contributes to the unending task of nation building,” the party said.
