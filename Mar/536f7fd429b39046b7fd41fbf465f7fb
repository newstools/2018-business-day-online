The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has described the announcement by the Buhari Presidency that the family of human right activist, Martin Luther King (Junior) conferred an award on President Muhammadu Buhari as a national disgrace and embarrassment. The PDP, in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, on Thursday, said the lie by President Buhari’s handlers smacks of desperation by the Presidency and the All Progressives Congress (APC), to procure international endorsement, ahead of the 2019 general elections. The party said the nation was jolted when the King Center distanced itself from the award and noted that, “the award given to President Buhari of Nigeria was not given by The King Center, at the request of The King Center or by the children of Martin Luther King jr. “It is now clear that this sinking, incompetent and deceptive APC administration, in their desperation, can fabricate and stage-manage anything, including name-dropping of international figures and agencies, in their desperate attempt to delude Nigerians, once again, now that the 2019 general election is fast approaching. “Nigerians have discovered that having failed to gain any endorsement from reputable international figures such as Bill Gates, the APC and the Presidency have now cheapened the nation by resorting to this despicable act of name-dropping of world-renowned human right activist, Dr. Martin Luther King jr, further dragging down our once sterling image before the comity of Nations. “The fact remains that not many Nigerians believed in the authenticity of the award in the first place, as the Buhari-led administration, by its undemocratic and anti-people proclivities, including records of violations of rights of citizens, is not deserving of any form of recognition by any human rights group, let alone the family of the world-acclaimed Martin Luther King jr,” the statement read. While urging the Presidency to shed its proclivity for lies, the party demanded the immediate arrest, investigation and prosecution of all the Presidency officials involved in the scandal.
