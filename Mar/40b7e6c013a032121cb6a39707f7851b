The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has been urged to improve democracy in the country by introducing public debates for aspirants at the level of primaries. The United Nigeria Group (TUNG), a group interested in fostering peace and unity of the country and community sensitisation on politics issues, gave the advice in Abuja. Speaking with journalists, the spokesman of the group, Bright Emenena, said the PDP could take democracy to new height despite being an opposition party. “I want to use this opportunity to put pressure on the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to make impact even as an opposition party by taking democracy to the next level in Nigeria. “They must ensure that the process of choosing a candidate at the primary is fair; they should go further by ensuring the contestants engage in public debate at the level of the primaries. “In this country, there have never been a time when a sitting president had made himself available for public debate but PDP can’t start something. “They can take democracy to another level by introducing debate at the primaries level so that contestants can make public their vision to the delegates and general public,” he said. Emenena said TUNG believes in the unity of the nation and engages only in activities that fosters the peace and security of the country. He said that the group is canvassing for former Vice President, Abubakar Atiku because he is most competent amongst those who had declared interest to run for 2019 presidential election. He said Atiku had done so much for the country but only little or nothing is being said about his achievements. Emenena said Atiku’s commitment to the development of democracy and the overall economy cannot be overemphasized.
