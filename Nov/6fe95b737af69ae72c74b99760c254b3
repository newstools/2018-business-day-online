The Lagos State Command said it has dismissed Inspector Kadima Useni, a drunk policeman who appeared in a video which was captured at Akowonjo in Dopemu area of Lagos State. The video caught the attention of Ibrahim Idris, who directed the state commissioner of police to fish the erring policeman for appropriate disciplinary action, according to CSP Chike Oti, the police spokesman. “The policeman who was stupefied after guzzling large quantity of alcoholic beverage was located and apprehended on November 7, 2018 at Police Mobile Force Squadron 22 Base, Ikeja, where he served by the Command Provost,” said CSP Oti. “During interrogation, the officer affirmed that he was the one in the video. He was tried in orderly room and summarily dismissed to serve as a deterrent to others.” Continuing, the spokesman said, “To prevent reoccurrence, of this type of incident, the commissioner of police has directed the officer in charge of the Command Provost Section to embark on tour of all police formations and barracks within the state with a view to identifying and shutting all beer parlours within the police community.” “In the same vein, the commissioner of police warns the general public against offering policemen alcoholic drinks while on duty. He said that any policeman found drunk on duty will be visited with similar punishment.”  Chinwe Agbeze
