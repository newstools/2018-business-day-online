Some states across Nigeria may not qualify to access interventions on its donor funded related projects‎ from its various global partners as most global bodies like the World Bank have prioritized Open Government Partnership (OGP) as a key factor that guarantees it commitment to funding projects.
The OGP is an international multi-stakeholder global coalition of reformers from the government and civil society, working together to make government more open and accountable. President Muhammadu Buhari at the anti-corruption summit hosted by the British Prime Minister at Marlborough House in the United Kingdom on May 11, 2016, said Nigeria would be joining the OGP. On the back of the President’s commitment at the summit, the Attorney General and the Minster of Justice, Abubakar Malami on June 22, 2016, sent Nigeria’s letter of Intent to the Global OGP secretariat. On July 27, 2016, the OGP Secretariat confirmed Nigeria as a participating country. Apart from Kaduna State, which is the only sub-national state in Nigeria that has inaugurated the state Action Plan for the Open Government Partnership, other states that have submitted letters of intents to commit to the course in their respective states include: Kano, Ebonyi, Abia, Enugu, Jigawa, Anambra, Edo, and Oyo. Other states not-mentioned risk not accessing most donor funded projects because most global bodies have commenced the process of ensuring that donor funded projects are tied to open government partnerships. Joshua James, executive director of Jay Concept, and OGP resource person, told newsmen at a media training programme on the project in Lokoja, “Across Kaduna State, we have several projects that are on going, courtesy of the state government making commitments towards OGP such as the primary health care under one roof, save the children initiative, the Kaduna Inland dry port is also among the projects. “Most of the donor funded projects we got in Kaduna State is as a result of the state government’s signatory to open government partnership which is one of the key demands of the global intervention agencies before they support state counter-part funded projects.”‎ ‎Kaduna State, Joshua explained, has gone ahead on the OGP implementation and has integrated it with the state Action Plan, local government development plan and sector development plans of the states, while also adopting community development charter to make government more transparent and participatory by the citizens. ‎Also, Uchenna Arisiukwu, programme officer for the African Centre for Leadership, Strategy and Development, a national steering committee member of the OGP at the event, urged states to sign on to the commitments as required to enable them drive developmental projects in their states, which the dwindling state resources may not deliver
