The camp of the gubernatorial candidate of Action Democratic Party (ADP), Christopher Adebayo Alao-Akala got a boost at the weekend as scores of African Democratic Congress (ADC) members dumped the party and joined the former governor of the state. Alao-Akala, who was a member and governorship aspirant under the All Progressives Congress (APC), joined the ADP after he could not secure the broom party’s ticket in the state. The former governor was among the 33 gubernatorial aspirants in APC but withdrew and accused Governor Abiola Ajimobi of imposition.
Since, he secured the ticket of ADP, he had remained a force to reckon with in the race for the Agodi Government House in the 2019 election.
To this end, his platform has continued to swell with over 3,000 defecting to his party from ADC which is now enmeshed in crisis over who will fly the party’s flag for next year. Among the defectors were market women, traders, artisans and youths led to the ADP by Khalil Mustapha, a State House of Assembly aspirant in Ibadan North Constituency 1. Speaking on the rationale behind the defection of the former ADC members, Mustapha said that their resolve to join ADP was due to series of internal crises that has been rocking the party (ADC) in the past few months which are yet to be solved.
He maintained that it was glaring that the leadership of ADC in Oyo State was more interested in their selfish ambition than the overall plight of the masses in the state thereby resulting in the unending crisis over the sharing of political offices to be contested for in the 2019 general elections.
