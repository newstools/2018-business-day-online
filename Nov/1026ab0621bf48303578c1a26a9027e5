The Minister of Communications, Adebayo Shittu, has closed the South West campaign office for President Muhammadu Buhari and Vice President Yemi Osinbajo ahead of the 2019 general election. The office inside a building located along Mokola-Ojoo Road in the heart of Ibadan, the Oyo State capital, was also meant to serve as the campaign office of Buhari and Osinbajo in the South West region, gubernatorial campaign office and Ministerial office of the embattled minister. This is coming weeks after the Saki-born lawyer-turned politician lost the bid to secure the gubernatorial ticket of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in Oyo State to former Deputy Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Bayo Adelabu.
The minister, one of the aspirants for gubernatorial ticket in the state, was disqualified by the screening committee of APC for failing to participate in National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) after graduation from the university. Investigations revealed that the banners and photographs which were earlier erected during the commissioning of the building have been removed while the building may have been offered for let after the Minister closed it. The office, which once served as beehive of activities, has been deserted, presently surrounded and over grown by weeds. This clearly shows that the building has been abandoned by the minister.
The office was commissioned on Saturday 20th January 2018.  Akinremi Feyisipo, Ibadan
