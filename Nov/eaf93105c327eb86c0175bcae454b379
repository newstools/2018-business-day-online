The ruling All Progressives Congress, APC has remained silent as the report of the detention of the party’s National Chairman, Adams Oshiomhole by the Department of State Services (DSS) continue to trend. TheCable Wednesday reported that Oshiomhole was grilled by DSS operatives for nine hours on Sunday after some APC governors alleged that he received bribes during the party’s primary elections across the country. According to the report, the APC chairman was asked to resign during interrogation by the DSS but he resisted the pressure to resign, saying he would only do so if he loses the confidence of President Muhammadu Buhari. Oshiomhole was said to have told the DSS that the President was in the loop of every action he took during the party’s primaries. “Adams Oshiomhole was arrested by the DSS, they didn’t show him any petition. It was alleged by some governors that he collected bribe during the primaries. “He was told to resign and he told DSS operatives that he will resign if he loses the confidence of the president. He said everything the party did, he (Buhari) was in the know”, a DSS source said. But a source in the Presidency said the president expressed shock at the governors’ move, saying he was not aware of the development. “On Monday night Oshiomhole met with the president and briefed him on what happened and the president was shocked. The president said he did not know about it and promised to look into it” the source disclosed. When contacted hours after the report went viral, Lanre Isa-onilu, APC National Publicity Secretary did not respond while other party officials refused to comment on the issue.  James Kwen, Abuja
