The Founder, Buhari Campaign Organisation (BCO), Hassan Isiaka, has advocated synergy among the various support groups canvassing for the second-term electoral victory of President Muhammadu Buhari in 2019 while cautioning them to shun in-fighting, fake news and other negative acts that could be detrimental to the main goal.
The Sarkin Kudu Yamma, who is presently a member of the Board of Trustees (BoT)
of Buhari Campaign Organisation, spoke in Ibadan, Oyo State capital yesterday at an interactive session with journalists. He expressed delight that BCO, which started humbly in 2014 as Buhari Campaign Organisation Arewa Community South West Zone, has now metamorphosed into a national support group with members spreading across the entire states of the federation. He also commended President Muhammadu Buhari for the “fatherly manner he successfully handled the issue of the workers minimum wage,” saying that the President actually meant well for the Nigerian labour. While noting with delight the high rate at which the present administration is also going about infrastructural development across the country, particularly in the areas of roads construction and rehabilitation, railway transportation system, power supply, agriculture and security, he said: “The future looks very bright for Nigerians with President Buhari at the helms of affairs.” Isiaka further said that “this is not a time for members of the Buhari Campaign Organisation to engage in self-aggrandisement, personal interest or intra-party wrangling.  Rather, it is a period for them to focus on educating the teeming masses on the good work the Federal Government has been doing across the country since the past three-and-half years.” “In this regard, therefore, what we need mostly is synergy amongst all loyalists of the Buhari Campaign Organisation at home and in the Diaspora, for the President to emerge victorious come 2019,” he further said.
