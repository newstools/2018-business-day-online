Nigeria’s House of Representatives on Wednesday unveiled plans to investigate the circumstances that led to the invasion and attempted
assassination of Deputy Senate President Ike Ekeremmadu.
Ekweremadu’s resident located at Apo Legislative Quarters, Abuja, was invaded by suspected assassins on Tuesday November 6, 2018.
The Deputy Senate President who resumed alongside his colleagues after two recess has threatened to release the video footage of the
incident.
The House passed the resolution sequel to the adoption of a motion of urgent public importance sponsored by Toby Okechukwu (PDP-Enugu). In his lead debate, Okechukwu observed that the attack happened at the lawmaker’s bedroom leading to assault and injuries on his first son. He expressed displeasure that the nation’s security agents particularly the Police could term such highly organised invasion and
assault on the lawmaker as mere burglary. While urging the House to investigate it, the PDP lawmaker further hinted that there were several unanswered calls placed on the phone of
the Inspector-General of Police IGP Ibrahim Idris and his deputy during the sad incident. On his part, Danburam Nuhu (PDP-Kano) who argued that the security agents are not doing enough to protect the citizens, called for
deliberate efforts toward proffering lasting solutions to the insecurity challenges in the country. Also in his contribution, Gabriel Onyewife (APGA-Anambra) said that the attack on the lawmaker should be approached with utmost concerns
by all well meaning Nigeria. He said the attack coming at a time when a general election is almost at the corner is dangerous development that would not give the country
a good image adding “who is safe”. While ruling, Speaker Dogara mandated the joint Committees on Police Affairs and National Security & Intelligence to investigate the matter
and report back to the House.
