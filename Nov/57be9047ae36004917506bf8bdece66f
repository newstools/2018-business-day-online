The Lagos State chapter of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), has described the reported endorsement of All Progressives Congress (APC), governorship candidate in the state, Jide Sanwo-Olu by forty political parties has a fraud that was initiated in a desperate move by the APC because it was becoming clear that the party would lose next year’s election and becoming obvious that Lagosian was tired of the party. The PDP in a statement signed by its Publicity Secretary, Taoffek Gani, noted that the controversial emergence of Sanwo-Olu was a clear desperate move by the national leader of the party, Asiwaju Ahmed Tinubu to have someone who would fund him. The party further described Sanwo-Olu as an emergency candidate that is unprepared for the job, stressing that the PDP was confident of winning next year’s election because its candidate had a blueprint which was focused on freeing Lagos since 2006. “Sanwo-Olu, is a ‘bad market’ that cannot appeal to Lagosians even if he ‘buys’ political parties beyond the registered ones in the country. “Hence it is laughable that some parties have adopted an unprepared candidate. It is not true that 40 political parties have adopted Sanwo-Olu. “The claim is propagandists and mere prodigal as indeed it is the APC candidate who is giving out huge sums of monies to get parties adopt him”. The PDP further promised to expose the APC governorship candidate as truly not fit and proper to govern the state at the appropriate time. “Lagosians are thus alerted that should Sanwo-Olu be mistakenly elected as governor, his urge will be to recuperate the election expenses. We are not shocked because we know Sanwo-Olu and his nominator are desperate to hold on to Lagos state. “At the appropriate time, we shall expose Sanwo-Olu as truly not fit to rule Lagos State and we would defeat the APC next year’s elections”.
