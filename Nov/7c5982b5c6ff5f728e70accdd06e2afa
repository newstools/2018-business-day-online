Ahead of Saturday’s by-election for a House of Representatives seat, Kwara State governor, Abdulfatah Ahmed, on Tuesday, called on the people of Irepodun, Oke- Ero, Ekiti and Isin local government areas of state to troop out en masse and vote for Saheed Alatise, the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Ahmed asked the people to reciprocate the kind gesture of the Saraki political dynasty which helped one of their sons to power as Kwara State governor since 2011. He also implored them to use the opportunity of the election to show their love for the former House of Representatives members from the constituency,  the late Princess Olufunke Adedoyin whom they all agreed performed excellently well as their representative during her lifetime. Ahmed who made the call while flagging off the PDP’s campaign for the by-election in Omu- Aran, the headquarters of Irepodun local government area, reminded the people of the monumental developmental projects that his administration had carried out in Kwara south in the past seven and a half years. He urged the people not to be intimidated by the heavy presence of security men in their communities, rather, they should feel free to come out and cast their votes for the PDP. The governor stated PDP will continue to win election in the state because of the transformation that every section of the state had witnessed between 2003 and now under the administration of Bukola Saraki and his own government. Ahmed who was joined on the campaign trail by the Speaker of the state House of Assembly, Ali Ahmad, the deputy chief of staff to Senate President, Gbenga Makanjuola and the state chairman of the PDP, Kola Shittu expressed the confidence that his party would coast home victory in not only the Saturday bye-election but the 2019 general elections as well.
