The Lagos State Command said it has arrested two alleged notorious robbers who specialize in robbing commuters and motorists who ply the Lekki/Epe expressway. The suspects, one Akpan Samuel and Ani Chukwuma were apprehended by operatives of the Command led by CSP Isah Abdulmajid, the Divisional Police Officer in Maroko Division. CSP Chike Oti, police spokesman said, the suspects disclosed their mode of operation when they were interrogated. “Their modus operandi was to mount the pedestrian bridge, Maruwa bus stop, Lekki/Epe expressway,” said CSP Oti. “At that vantage position, they were able to monitor the traffic and carefully select their target.” Upon selecting their targets, the police spokesman said the alleged robbers would swoop on them and dispose them of their valuables. “They use a big hammer to smash the side glasses and windscreens of drivers who refused to roll down their glasses when commanded to do so,” he said. “The hammer and an improvised pistol that appears like a perfect prototype of a berratta pistol were recovered from them.” According to CSP Oti, the suspects were remanded in Ikoyi prison after their arraignment at Igbosere Magistrate-Court-ten on November 1, 2018. “Their activities were a source of concern to the Command. So, the state commissioner of police directed the DPO to mobilise all assets at his disposal to ensure the arrest and prosecution of the hoodlums,” CSP Oti added. “The Commissioner of police assures that the activities of this set of criminals will soon be a thing of past as the Command has increased surveillance along all routes with heavy traffic.”  Chinwe Agbeze
