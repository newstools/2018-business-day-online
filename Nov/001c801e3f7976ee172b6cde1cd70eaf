President Muhammadu Buhari will depart Abuja today, Friday for Paris, France to participate in the first edition of the Paris Peace Forum, holding from November 11 to 13, 2018. Organised by the French Government and a number of Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs), the Forum is based on the “simple idea that international cooperation is key to tackling global challenges and ensuring durable peace.” A statement by the Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, said the Nigerian President will join the United Nations Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres and other world leaders in discussing contributions towards global peace while underscoring the imperative of collective action. While in Paris, President Buhari will also join other world leaders to commemorate the centenary anniversary of the Armistice signed on November 11, 1918 between the Allied Forces and Germany in the forest of Compiegne in France to end the First World War. During his visit to Paris, President Buhari will attend a luncheon hosted by President Emmanuel Macron of France in honour of visiting heads of delegations. Before returning to Abuja, the President and his delegation will have an interactive session with the Nigerian Community in France.
