SPOTLIGHT NIGERIA 2018- PRESS RELEASE Paris, 10th October 2018 Friends of Nigeria (FON) organized the Spotlight Nigeria 2018 which held October 4th – 5th at the Marriott Rive Gauche Hotel & Conference Center, Paris. The event offered a platform for business leaders, companies and investors meet to discuss opportunities and forge partnerships related to investments in Nigeria, Africa’s largest economy. Over 150 business leaders and investors from seven (7) countries attended, with most from France and Nigeria. Spotlight Nigeria 2018 was co-organized with the Embassy of Nigeria in Paris under the patronage of the Ambassador of Nigeria to France, H.E Dr. Modupe. The event had notable organizations as sponsors and partners for the event, mostly leading organizations across various sectors. It would be recalled that President Emmanuel Macron visited Nigeria in July 2018, and became the first French president to spend ample time in Lagos, Nigeria’s foremost Commercial city. Friends of Nigeria (FON) was the only non-profit that was enlisted as a founding member of the France-Nigeria Business Club that was launched by President Emmanuel Macron during his visit to Nigeria. During his address to young entrepreneurs, President Macron emphasized non-traditional sectors; especially the creative industry, cultural sectors, and the technology. These sectors allow for greater youth participation, cultural exchanges, inclusive entrepreneurship, and development. Spotlight Nigeria 2018 featured top quality roundtable discussions that addressed concrete opportunities and the challenges of doing business in Nigeria, interactive Q&A sessions, detailed presentations that provided clarity on different administrative processes related to investment in Nigeria and also matchmaking sessions where companies had the chance to discuss partnership opportunities and projects. From the various sessions and engagements, the following consensus was re-echoed; Nigeria’s oil and gas sector is not a representative of Nigeria’s potential. Oil and Gas contributed less than 10 percent to GDP in Q1 of 2018, with non-traditional sectors and services contributing the most to GDP and to the economy.         A number of partnership opportunities were discussed and consummated during the Spotlight Nigeria 2018. Indeed, it can be said that the event engendered “partnership that works”.
