The Debt Management Office (DMO) on Wednesday released its new strategic plan the expiration of the 3rd Strategic Plan (2013 – 2017). The building blocks for the 4th Strategic Plan are: changing investor needs and higher investor expectations from the DMO on products and services; government’s prioritisation of the development of infrastructure which requires new and more creative ways of financing; and among others, the active and supportive role expected of the DMO under the ERGP, two of whose pillars are reducing the infrastructure gap and a private sector-led growth. The Broad Objective of the 4th Strategic Plan is: to use Debt and Debt-related instruments to support Nigeria’s development goals, while ensuring that public debt is sustainable. The Office noted the major challenges encountered in the implementation of the 3rd Strategic Plan to include the non-passage of DMO Amendment Act; inadequate funding for the implementation of some initiatives; low staff morale due to continued delays in the actualization of key human resource issues, such as remuneration and less than optimal posting of staff and; inability to properly manage certain categories of external stakeholders.
