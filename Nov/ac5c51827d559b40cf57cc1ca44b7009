The United Kingdom (UK) has expressed concerns over the  clashes between the Nigerian security forces and members of the Islamic Movement of Nigeria, otherwise known as Shiites that led to the killing of about 50 Shiite members during protests to free detained Shiite leader, Ibraheem El-Zakzaky in Abuja. A statement issued by the British High Commission in Abuja, made available to our correspondent on Sunday said” our thoughts are with the families of those people who have lost their lives. We are following events closely, and have expressed our concerns about the levels of violence and numbers of people killed to the Federal government.” The UK also encouraged all parties to work together to enable the people of Nigeria to exercise freedom of association, expression and religious belief safely, peacefully and in line with the rule of law. “It is essential that security forces act in accordance with international and domestic law and work to protect civilians,” the statement said. “We welcome commitments by the Government of Nigeria to conduct a thorough investigation and to take appropriate action to hold accountable any member of the security forces held responsible for violations of Nigerian law,” the statement added.
