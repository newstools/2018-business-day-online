In order to keep our environment clean, Eze Cyril Ogbenna, the traditional ruler of Uzi-Amizi autonomous community, Umuahia South Local Government of Abia State has advised governments at various levels to provide receptacle bins in major cities of the country. Ogbenna noted that the absence of adequate receptacles in major cities of the country has been a source of worry to Nigerians. The monarch lamented that Nigerian environmental system was backwards when compared with countries like China. “I have not lived in China but only visited there for a couple of months. When you see what is happening in China as regards their environmental system, there is no way you can compare Nigeria with it,” he said. “Receptacles are placed at every junction and you dare not drop refuse or rubbish carelessly. If there is any how garbage is dropped on the street, those responsible for cleaning the particular street will immediately pick it up and dispose adequately,” he further said. According to him, “There are people in China, employed to sweep, clean and pick every bit of things found on the street, but here in Nigeria, it is not like that, receptacles are not adequate”. Eze Ogbenna advised that Nigeria should engage the services of indigenous technicians to fabricate receptacles so as to have enough of them to fill the yawning gaps. “If Nigeria cannot order for enough receptacles, there are lots of technicians in Nigeria that can construct them, so that the surging refuse can be evacuated appropriately,” he said. He opined that rather than observing general sanitation on monthly basis, the exercise should be done on a daily basis. “There is no how you can keep a receptacle bin on a street like Isi-gate axis in Umuahia and within two days, you have not removed it and you expect people living around there to be in good health. We have to rethink and re-plan this country”, he suggested.
