The National chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), John Odigie-Oyegun and other members of he National Working Committee (NWC) of the ruling party have survived what could have ended their tenure as officials of the party on Monday. Indications to this development emerged when the  forum of state chairmen of the APC declared a vote of confidence on John Oyegun, even as the state leaders expressed support for the much touted tenure elongation for the party officers at all level.
In a communiqué signed by 31 state chairmen obtained by BusinessDay on Monday night after an emergency meeting ahead of Tuesday’s National Executive Council (NEC) meeting, the forum also passed a vote of confidence on President Muhammadu Buhari and beckoned on him to contest the 2019 presidential election.
The Chief John Odigie-Oyegun led NWC is said to  be having some intense battles with some interests within the party especially as regards the tenure elongation proposal for the party’s national executive  members. Some of the state chairmen, who signed the communiqué were Chief Henry Ajomale, who is consider to be an implacable supporter of Asiwaju Bola Tinubu.
The communiqué read: “In view of the short period between the time available for the proposed party congresses and INEC published time table for conduct of party primaries and general elections, the forum resolved that the tenure of the present officers of the party at all levels be extended by two years to avert challenges in the party.
“In view of the reasons as adduced above, and the fact that the present constitution as amended in 2014 has not been fully tested in the short life of the party, the forum resolved that the proposed amendment of the party constitution be suspended.
“The forum extends our heartfelt condolences and sympathizes with the good mode of Benue, Adamawa, Taraba, Zamfara, Yobe and Bomo States for the attacks on them by the enemies of our dear country.”  Innocent Odoh, Abuja
