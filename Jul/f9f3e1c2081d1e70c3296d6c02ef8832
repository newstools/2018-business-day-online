Cleopatra the Tapir, who lives at the Nizhny Novgorod’s Limpopo zoo, has predicted Croatia’s victory over France in the upcoming 2018 FIFA World Cup final, the zoo’s press service informed TASS on Friday. The World Cup’s final match will take place on July 15, at Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow. Earlier, the animal’s predictions were on target for 6 out of 8 games. “Today, Cleopatra is far more certain of her prediction than ever before. Without a second thought, she approached the fruit bowl with a Croatian flag on it. It seems that Croatia will have a sure victory,” the press service said. Among the clairvoyant animals making predictions for the World Cup matches are: Achilles the cat from St. Petersburg, Pushok the rabbit from Sochi, Puzyr the whale from Anapa, and Spartak the lemur from Yekaterinburg.
