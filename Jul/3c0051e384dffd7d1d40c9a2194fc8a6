Management of multinational oil and gas firm Mobil Producing Nigeria, a subsidiary of ExxonMobil, says none of the sacked Supernumerary (SPY) police officers are being replaced with expatriate staff as the company is already making plans to assist them with police employment opportunities.
“In addition to receiving a separation package that includes compensation based on years of service and position; the affected personnel will be offered assistance from a Human Resources consultant to help find employment opportunities with a third-party security services provider,” ExxonMobil said in a statement sent to BusinessDay.
ExxonMobil added that the activities undertaken by ExxonMobil to provide compensation packages to the individuals affected by the April 2018 Supreme Court judgment is consistent with the Court’s ruling and prior company practices.
“This is a limited program that will impact only individuals within the scope of the Supreme Court judgment,” ExxonMobil said.
Staff of ExxonMobil last week closed down the Lagos headquarters of the company over the alleged sacking of 860 spy police without entitlements.
The company’s workers’ union protested the sacking of these workers, who were mostly Nigerians saying, they were sacked by ExxonMobil in breach of labour laws despite putting in over 22 years of service accusing the management of refusing to comply with Supreme Court Judgement.
Recall on April 20, 2018, the Nigerian Supreme Court ruled that all SPY police personnel were employees of ExxonMobil and were thus entitled to all remunerations, benefits, terms and conditions as employees of ExxonMobil as approximately 925 personnel are affected by the ruling.
As a result, ExxonMobil implemented a non-voluntary separation program in July 2018 for police officers as approximately 500 affected personnel were still in active service. ExxonMobil spokesperson, Ogechukwu Udeagha said the company complied with the Supreme Court ruling by acknowledging the spy police as employees however given the business model calculating their emoluments and benefits was a challenge as the highest certificate most of them have was a School Certificate.
“The least of them will get a minimum of 10 years annual basic salary and allowances up till July 13, 2018, in addition to August salary paid in lieu of one month notice of disengagement from service,” ExxonMobil noted.
ExxonMobil emphasised that the ex-police officers are not staff of ExxonMobil rather they were hired or recruited and trained by the Nigeria Police and deployed to Mobil Producing Nigeria however the company had been paying them through the police.
ExxonMobil added that the union members who have elected to join the strike are not affected by recent activities and urge them to respect the judicial process and the established procedures for resolving industrial disputes.
“We respect the right to peacefully protest, however it is illegal to restrict access to housing and business facilities,” ExxonMobil said.  DIPO OLADEHINDE
