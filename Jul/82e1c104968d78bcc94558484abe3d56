 Enterprise Singapore works to create the right ecosystem companies and also works with companies to improve productivity, and also find the right talent for their businesses. Officials say that in Singapore, there is a high level of trust between the government and business. Businesses share their concerns with the governments so that the government can effect meaningful policies that can help Singapore companies grow. The aim, according to officials, is to create, an open economy that is able to attract FDI. The philosophy behind this is that Singapore is a small economy and therefore the only way Singapore companies can grow is to go overseas. The aim of the government is to ensure that they have the right fundamentals to do so. How the government promotes labour productivity The Singapore government actively promotes labour productivity. The government ensures that what students learn in school prepares them adequately for the job market. The government therefore ensures that there is a lot of collaboration between schools and industry. The government also ensures that there is continuous education of the workforce through the encouragement of companies to send their workforce for training and upskilling.
