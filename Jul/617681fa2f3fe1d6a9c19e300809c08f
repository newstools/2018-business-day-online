The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has welcomed the Senate President, Bukola Saraki, Kwara State Governor, Ahmed Abdulfatah and the Nigerian Ambassador to South Africa, Ahmed Ibeto, to its fold. The party says the coming of the trio could not have been at a better time than now. In a statement on Tuesday night, Kola Ologbondiyan, PDP National Publicity Secretary, noted the harassment and intimidation that Saraki and Governor Ahmed had suffered from the governing All Progressives Congress (APC) which they helped to build and nurtured to win elections. “Senator Saraki, in particular, has conducted the affairs of the Senate in reflection of the wishes of the silent majority of Nigerians and had emerged a hero of democracy. “The party has no doubts that Senator Saraki, Governor Ahmed and Alhaji Ibeto will contribute immensely to the new order that engender good governance in our nation. “The PDP assures all returning members of all the rights and privileges accruable to every member of our party. “Furthermore, the PDP calls on all Nigerians who are desirous of rescuing our nation from the incompetent administration of President Buhari to rally with party of choice, PDP, ahead of the 2019 elections”.
