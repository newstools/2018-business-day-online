WhatsApp is taking the fight against fake news to a whole new level with an update that limits how many times a single message can be forwarded. The company is owned by Facebook which is also battling with fake new epidemic on its Messaging App that has allegedly incited violence including lynching in countries like India. “Today, we are launching a test to limit forwarding that will apply to everyone using WhatsApp,” the messaging platform wrote in a statement. User in India will only be able to send their messages to five chats. For the rest of the world, users can send to 20 chats. Forwarded messages will have a small “forwarded” label, similar to forwarded email messages, indicating the note was originally written by someone other than the sender. WhatsApp is doing away with the “quick forward” option that appears alongside media messages. It also added new admin controls for group messages, as well as bigger initiative to study fake news. The company said the objective for the new updates was to “help keep WhatsApp the way it was designed to be: a private messaging app. “We are deeply committed to your safety and privacy which is why WhatsApp is end-to-end encrypted, and we will continue to improve our app with features like this one.”
