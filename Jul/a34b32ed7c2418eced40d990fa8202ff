Nigerian stock market moved further into the negative territory after Wednesday’s trading session on Customs Street-Lagos as sell pressure around equities outweighed buy decisions. Increasing negatives around stocks are indications that Pension Fund Administrators (PFAs) implementation of multi-fund investment structure (MFS) on Retirement Saving Account (RSA) has not really triggered substantial shift from debt to equities. Despite concerns over rising political risks, investors expect impressive first-half (H1) scorecards to help reroute equities market northward. The National Pension Commission (PenCom) recently replaced the “one size fits all” investment structure for PFAs with the Multi-Fund Structure (MFS) regulation which considers for age or risk profile of such contributors. The multi-fund structure which requires pension contributors to choose one of the four fund types to invest their RSA became effective on July 2, 2018. Market watchers had expected that Pension Fund Administrators to reduce allocation of assets under management (AUM) to Federal Government securities as a result of declining yields. The FGN bond market was fairly active on Wednesday as yields narrowed for several traded maturities across the curve. “It is unlikely that the implementation of the MFS framework will have an immediate impact on the equities market, especially with the 6 months transition period provided for PFAs, to restructure their portfolios in accordance to the framework”, according to United Capital Research analysts in their May 29 note to investors. Analysts note that within a broader trend in the emerging/frontier economy space, Lagos Bourse joined two other leading stock markets in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) – Johannesburg Stock Exchange and Nairobi Stock Exchange that find themselves in negative territory year-to-date (Ytd). “The Ramaphosa bounce in South Africa did not last long: the Jo’burg index has been under water since the start of February. Nigeria has its own elections coming: in our view, investors are not worried while they feel that the polls will be decisive, and not followed by violence and endless judicial challenges”, Gregory Kronsten–led team of analysts at FBNQuest Capital said in their July 11, 2018 note to investors.
