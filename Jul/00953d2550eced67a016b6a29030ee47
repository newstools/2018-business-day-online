CEOs are known for their confidence. And yet, that confidence sometimes flags, as we at leadership advisory firm Egon Zehnder learned from a survey of 402 CEOs from 11 countries. Participating anonymously, CEOs told us that while they did feel ready for the strategic and business aspects of their roles, they felt much less prepared for the personal and interpersonal components of leadership, which are just as critical to success. Here are some surprising findings: 68% acknowledged that, in hindsight, they weren’t fully prepared to take on the CEO role. 50% said driving culture change was more difficult than they’d anticipated. 48% said that finding time for themselves and for self-reflection was harder than expected. Remarked one: “When you become the final decisionmaker, everything changes. It’s hard to train on this.” How should organizations address these CEO development gaps? We suggest three immediate actions: — Underscore, in succession planning, executive training programs and elsewhere, that success comes from adopting a mindset of constant personal growth. — Boards should work with CEOs before, during, and especially after they have been selected, moving beyond selection to provide real feedback and serve as a trusted source of guidance. — Better integrate both internal and external hires. One surprising finding of our survey was that internally selected CEOs expressed more concerns than externally selected ones about their ability to adjust to the new role and build a group of supporters. These survey results, we believe, are a call to action. If unaddressed, the implications go far beyond the personal legacies of these CEOs and will affect the performance of their companies.
