The Eko Electricity Distribution Company (EKEDC) says two vandals were apprehended on Tuesday night at Lugard Avenue, Ikoyi, Lagos over stolen cable valued at N340,000. Mr Godwin Idemudia, the General Manager, Corporate Communications of EKEDC, said in a statement on Wednesday in Lagos that the vandals were caught while trying to vandalise the upriser cable and handed over to the Police. According to the Idemudia, the vandals had earlier carted away 20 meters 500mm single core armoured cable from the feeder pillar to the 500KVA transformer. “The estimated cost of the stolen armoured cable is N340,000.00, while the loss of revenue presently is estimated to be hundreds of thousands, as all customers on Lugard Avenue are in darkness. “The Investigation Police Officer (IPO) in charge of the case has finalised arrangements for the arraignment of the suspects in court as soon as possible,” he said. Idemudia urged residents within EKEDC network to protect the company equipment within their communities, noting that the company had lost over N1 billion to various forms of energy theft and vandalism. “Eko Disco will no longer tolerate this act of illegal tampering with our equipment and electrical installations. “Tampering with Eko Disco meters, installations, distribution lines, equipment or assault on any field worker will attract a jail term,” he said.
