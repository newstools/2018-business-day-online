The Ekiti State Government and the European Union (EU) have collaborated to rehabilitate Egbe dam also called ‘little Osse’ to boost water supply and agricultural activities in the state. As a result, over N1billion contracts have been awarded for the rehabilitation of the dam. The project which is being funded by the state in partnership with the EU under the water supply and sanitation sector reform programme phase III is expected to guarantee stable water supply to five Local Government Areas made up of Gbonyin, Ado, Ise/Orun, Emure and Ekiti East LGA. Tunde Ogunleye, Ekiti State Commissioner for Public Utilities made this known in Ado Ekiti during a familiarization meeting with the contractors handling the projects and other stakeholders. Ogunleye said that the development would also take care of the rehabilitation of the water schemes in Aramoko, Ido-Ile, Erijiyan, Ikogosi, Ipole-Iloro, Erio and Okemesi. Represented by Olumide Ajayi, permanent secretary in the Ministry, the commissioner explained that the contractors had been given 18months to complete the projects, adding that government would not only expect timely delivery of the tasks, but they must be of high quality and executed according to specifications. He therefore urged the contractors to be professional and ethical at all levels of service delivery in order to achieve the desired objective. Charging all benefiting communities to cooperate with the contractors, Ogunleye stressed the need for them to take ownership of the projects emphasising the need to continually support efforts at developing the state and improving the lot of the people. He assured that government would continue to collaborate with interested development partners to develop the state and make life more meaningful for the people.
