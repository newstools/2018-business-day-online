Akinwunmi Ambode, Governor of Lagos State, has presented grants of about N500m to Community Development Associations (CDAs) in the state for the promotion of self-help projects in their various constituencies.  The Governor who made the presentation yesterday at De Blue Roof, at the Lagos Television (LTV) premises in Ikeja, reiterated his administration’s commitment to good governance and inclusive leadership.  He urged the communities to remain selfless to their commitments, adding that the state is always ready to support at all times.  “Today is historical as interventions to the tune of N500m have been provided for the 275 CDAs, ranging from N1m to N10m. I am happy to note that the volume of these grants is historic and will be a continuous exercise,” Ambode said.  “It is my expectation that all the projects covered by these grants will be completed for the usage of the communities. The real government is at the community level, reason why we are giving them priority,” he further said.  He said the need for government intervention for the projects have become very compelling, as they were well conceived to help communities.  The governor appealed to the communities to take full responsibility of all the amenities.  Speaking also during the presentation, Akeem Sulaimon, Special Adviser to the Governor on Communities and Communications, said “today, we have come to actualise the translation of that vision to action, the transformation of our promise to reality across the length and breadth of the state.” Sulaimon stated that the current administration’s commitment is to articulate the concept of inclusive governance, a system in which its policies, projects and programmes will be driven by the needs of various communities as a springboard for social and economic development.
