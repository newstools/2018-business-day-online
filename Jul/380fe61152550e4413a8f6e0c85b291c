Large numbers of All Progressive Congress (APC) members from the Kwara state chapter of the party, Tuesday morning stage a protest at the party’s headquarters in Abuja demanding the expulsion of the Senate President, Bukola Saraki from the party, while also backing the decision of the National Working Committee (NWC) to dissolve the Kwara APC executive and set up a caretaker committee.  Last Monday, the National Executive Committee of the APC dissolved the Kwara APC executive, which had recently pledged loyalty to the Senate President, while also setting up a care taker committee.  Although the Senate President has not announced his defection form the party, it is expected that he would do that any moment from now, while some of his allies and some lawmakers form kwara State were among the defectors to the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) last week. The protesters said they would not wait for the Senate President to officially announce his defection from the APC, while urging the Party leadership to expelled him. Leader of the group, Tayo Awodiji, while speaking to Journalist, said that the Senate President recent actions constituted anti-Party activities which were enough for his expulsion. “The dissolution of the Balogun APC executives in Kwara State by Adams Oshiomhole and the National Working Committee is highly commendable as it is long awaited,” Awodeji added that the dissolution will pave way for proper repositioning of the party ahead of the 2019 election. The protesters also called for the conduct of fresh membership registration in the state and the recall of the Kwara lawmakers who defected from APC.
