Contrary to insinuations that the Senator representing Kaduna Central Senatorial District, Shehu Sani has dump the All Progressives Congress, APC, the vocal Lawmaker insisted that he is still a member of the ruling party. Sani dispersed the rumour while briefing newsmen in Abuja where he disclosed that he is in talks with APC and other parties for the next line of action. He lamented that he and some members of the party have suffered injustices, marginalisation and inequality from previous leadership of the party. “I have not yet opted out of the APC but I can confirm we are talking with the PDP and we are talking with the APC and what is pushing us out of the APC is inherent injustice, marginalisation and inequity that have visited us. “We have been treated badly by the party in the last three years but we are appreciating that we have a chairman, in the person of Comrade Adams Oshiomhole”, Sani stated. The Kaduna Central Senator commended the present Oshiomhole-led National Working Committee for its move to resolve all lingering issues, adding that he and some members are presently exploring ways to get out of the party. Sani however,  revealed that their decisions to leave the party will be made known in the next few days. He said, “we are also exploring options of getting out of the party, but who remains in the party, the issue is still on discussion. “Our decisions will be in the matter of weeks and not in the matter of months where we are going to review whether we will remain in the party or we will go to cross the red sea out of Egypt to the promised land”, the Senator maintained.
