Mr Aderemi Banjo, a  chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC), in Lagos State, on Thursday advised politicians to desist from political thuggery during elections in the country. Banjo gave the advice in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos, identifying political thuggery as the bane of elections in the nation. He urged security agencies to up their games by monitoring closely all persons involved in such practice. Banjo, a former national chairman of Mega Progressive Party, also appealed to politicians to contribute more to the development of their constituencies. He said there was the need for more developmental projects in his area in Surulere Constituency 1, Lagos. The politician, who is aspiring  for the House of Representatives seat for the area, called for better legislative ideologies that would involve welfare of the people as well as good relationship with state and local government authorities. He commended Sen. Oluremi Tinubu (APC-Lagos Central) for doing well for the people of the state at the senatorial level. Banjo called for harmony between legislators and state governors, stressing that only such a relationship could bring speedy development to the state. He said it was regretful that there was disagreement between some state governors and their federal lawmakers, calling for more understanding.
