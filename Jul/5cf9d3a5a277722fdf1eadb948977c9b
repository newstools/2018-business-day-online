A capital market expert, Mr Sola Oni, on Monday attributed the lull in the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) to portfolio- switching by some foreign investors for higher returns in the U.S. Oni,  a Stockbroker and Chief Executive Officer, Sofunix Investment and Communications, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos that many foreign investors had embarked on portfolio switching because some collective investments were generating higher returns in America. “We learnt that some collective investments are generating higher returns in the U.S., making many foreign investors to embark on portfolio-switching,” he said. Switching refers to the process of transferring investments. Within the prevailing investment market, investors may wish to switch from one fund to another. Oni said it was not unusual that foreign investors were curious about what the general elections next year, thereby selling off their equities. He said that investors would always realise profits in any market, adding that this was normal. “If you watch the trend over the last couple of weeks, it has been a buyers’ market as supply side is higher than demand, and buyers are at liberty to buy at low prices. “However, we should appreciate that most share prices of our listed companies are undervalued, relative to their intrinsic value. “Therefore, the market is a veritable platform for real investors who have a fairly long investment horizon,” he said.
