The event also marked the return of the Chairman Senate Committee on FCT, Dino Melaye and Kawu Baraje – a strong ally of Senate President Bukola Saraki – to the party. The MoU reads in part: “THAT the Parties shall work together to ensure the emergence of a joint presidential candidate of which modalities for this collegiate process shall be under a separate Agreement by the Parties. “THAT the Parties shall promote a positive reaction to the above listed failures of the present regime and to give hope to all our people, the Parties shall ensure that the coalition is committed to working together in support of the single Presidential Candidate to contest the 2019 Presidential election in order to successfully enthrone a true democrat who will salvage the nation from the misrule of the APC Government. “THAT the Parties shall promote acceptable core values for the restructuring of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, secure lives and property, rebuild and redirect our nation’s economy back onto the path of growth, respect human rights and freedoms, protect and uphold the cherished values of democracy and the democratic institutions and generally put right the country which unfortunately has now been dangerously divided along ethnic, religious and tribal lines. “THAT the Parties shall encourage State alliances between themselves to ensure that the cooperating parties under the grand alliance emerge victorious at State Governorship, State Legislature and National Assembly elections. “THAT the Parties accept the policy of zoning political and elective offices between the six geOpoliticat zones of the Federations. “THAT the Parties shall ensure that the emergent President under the grand alliance shall treat the presentation of an Executive Bill on Restructuring and Devolution of powers to the National Assembly a major priority”. In his goodwill message, the R-APC National Chairman, Buba Galadima, said he is certain that President Buhari would lose his deposit in the 2019 poll, even as he advised him nor to recontest. Galadima, a former ally of Buhari, said they are ready to lay down their lives for the sake of the country.
