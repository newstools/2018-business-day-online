Benue state Governor Samuel Ortom on Monday disclosed that he has been sent out of his present political party, All Progressives Congress, APC and is currently exploring a new option to actualise his future ambition.  The Governor stated this on Monday at the Benue Peoples House, Makurdi while swearing in his Special Adviser on Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs, Jerome Torshimbe.  He noted that he was consulting with relevant stakeholders, stressing that he would soon make his next move known to Benue people.  Governor Ortom charged the new appointee to justify the confidence reposed in him through hardwork and commitment to duty and to imbibe the core values of his administration which include transparency, accountability, justice and equity.  The Governor stated that Torshimbeâ€™s appointment was based on his capacity to serve especially at a critical time like this, even as he charged him to reach out to all.  The Special Adviser while pledging to justify the confidence reposed in him, also promised to give his best for good governance at the third tier of government and to reposition the traditional institution in the state.  He solicited the support of all to enable him succeed in his new assignment.  Also today at the Benue Peoples House, Governor Ortom received Sankara Food Sellers Association on a courtesy call where he promised them a trailer load of fertilizer and yam pounding machines to be given to them as loans in partnership with Bank of Industry.  The association, under the leadership of Esther Dam-Ayali, had earlier applauded Governor Ortom for standing firm against open grazing of livestock, stressing that as food sellers, the law was a step in the right direction.
