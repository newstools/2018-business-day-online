According to him “Flying with Lufthansa was beyond what I expected the experience will be. I had a wonderful experience and still processing the excitement in my head. I must also say that I enjoyed using Lufthansa Flynet. And concerning my experience in Russia, I had fun meeting fans from different countries wearing the Nigerian jerseys, visiting iconic places in Saint Petersburg, and the Trinity Bridge was an emotional one for me as I have never seen a bridge open and close at specific times of the day. A bridge that detaches itself is just wow. Most fans in the country are always ready to relate with other fans. Thank you Lufthansa for the opportunity I have no choice but to always #SayYesTotheWorld.”  Lufthansa offers daily flights from Lagos, Abuja and Port Harcourt via Frankfurt to over 200 destinations in Europe, USA, Canada and beyond.
