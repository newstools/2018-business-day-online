Nigeria Employers’ Consultative Association (NECA) warns the Federal Government to tame its appetite for borrowings and rather explore opportunities within by expanding the tax net for funds to further grow the economy. NECA, a key member of the Organised Private Sector (OPS), is of the view that Nigeria’s revenue and debt ratio of debt is unsustainable and worrisome, as the country is gradually slipping into the pre-debt relief period. Larry Ettah, the out-gone president of NECA, raised the concern at the association’s annual general meeting, in Lagos, Tuesday. According to Ettah, “we’re very worried that for the third consecutive year, the rising cost of debt servicing is in the top three allocations in the national budget. “In the last three years, the government has had a budget of about N18.012 trillion. This reflected in 2015 which was N4.493 trillion; 2016, which was N6.077 trillion and 2017, which was N7.441 trillion, of which debt service alone took an average of 23.71%, more than one-fifth of the budgets, amounting to N18.012 trillion. This leaves N13.74 trillion for recurrent and capital expenditures.” Ettah making reference to the recent Global Economic Perspective, expressed the worry that the current optimism over Nigeria’s economic recovery is tempered by concerns, one of which is the rising debt profile. He explained that although the debt level as a percentage of GDP seemed in order, the debt to revenue ratio was certainly unhealthy and unsustainable, and “we therefore advise the government to tame its appetite for more leverage.” Details later…
