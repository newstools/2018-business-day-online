A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and an Osogbo, Osun State-based legal practitioner, Tiamiyu Sule Adegboyega, has joined the race to the Osun State House of Assembly, saying, “Osun State belongs to the APC.” The Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU),-trained lawyer cum politician, told our correspondent in Osogbo that, “law interpretation has relevance with law-making,” asserting, “I wish to bring legislative policy closer to my constituency if afforded the opportunity to serve.” According to him, the existing laws in the state are largely received from the old Oyo State and no longer apt to the modern legislative trends, and as such need facelift, pointing out that, “Assembly in Osun State needs to live up to a better legislative functions, apart from the oversight duties that will enhance positive co-existence and harmony in the state.” The 56 year-old aspirant, who wants to represent Olorunda State Constituency at the Legislative House, is not new to law making as he was elected as a councillor and leader of the House at Olorunda Local Government, Igbona in Osogbo between 1990 and 1993. “That period signalled the beginning of my involvement in active politics,” he declared. Adegboyega, who currently practises his profession at Adewale Afolabi & Co. Chambers in Osogbo, disclosed that he is already consulting with his good people within the Olorunda State Constituency to sample their opinions on his intention to give them robust representation at the State House of Assembly from next year.
