Algeria is considering submitting a joint bid to host the 2030 FIFA World Cup with Morocco and Tunisia, Algeria’s sports minister said, just weeks after Rabat lost out to a US-led bid to host the 2026 tournament with Canada and Mexico. Sports Minister Mohamed Hattab told reporters that his country, which has at times been at odds with its neighbour Morocco – notably over the Western Sahara issue – would “study the possible candidacy of the Maghreb countries for the organisation of the World Cup”. “An application from the Maghreb with Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia can be achieved through existing infrastructure as well as future projects,” said Hattab. “When we look at our cities, with the sporting and culture facilities present, we are able to consider that we can host major world events.” Morocco, which has failed in all of its five attempts to host the tournament, voiced its interest in bidding for the 2030 edition immediately after learning it had failed to secure the 2026 run. Moncef Belkhayat, a member of Morocco’s failed 2026 bidding committee, said in June that King Mohammed VI had the ambition to see the North African country host the event in 2030. “I’m delighted his Majesty King Mohammed VI has taken the decision to make Morocco a bid nation for World Cup 2030,” Belkhayat said at the time. “It shows also our perseverance to do better and better for the sake of Morocco and worldwide football.” Both Morocco and Tunisia made it to this year’s tournament but were eliminated at the group stage while Algeria, absent in Russia, made it to the second round in Brazil back in 2014.
