Oando, Nigeria’s largest integrated energy solutions provider which is listed on both the Nigerian Stock Exchange and Johannesburg Stock Exchange, and the Cement Company of Northern Nigeria (CCNN) last Friday gave stakeholders in the nation’s capital market an idea of what to expect by year end with the release of impressive half year financial results for the period ended June 30, 2018. In just some few hours after the release of their H1 2018 financial results, market sentiments swayed in their favour as the prices of the two stocks rose significantly leading to the addition of N8.6 billion to their market capitalisation. Oando recorded 11.4 percent increase in gross earnings which rose from N266.98 billion in June 2017 to N297.31 billion in June 2018. Gross profit jumped by 52.6 percent from N33.43 billion in June 2017 to N51.01 billion same period this year. Profit after tax (PAT) as at H1 2018 was impressive at N8.5 billion, and that amounted to an increase of over 5,000 percent when compared with a loss after tax of N172million in corresponding period in 2017. Wale Tinubu, Oando Group’s chief executive officer attributed the impressive results to stable operational environment and increased demand for crude oil at the international market.   “I am pleased to report that Oando Plc has made significant progress in 2018, evidenced by our substantial free cash flow generation and profitability. Oil prices have rallied over the last year, a direct consequence of increasing demand and reduced supply. Higher oil prices, and the resolution of joint venture funding challenges with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has driven increased investment in the upstream sector. This stable operating environment, coupled with our fiscal prudence, has reinforced our solid financial footing as we continue to build on the momentum garnered in 2017”, Tinubu said. Cost to sales reduced from 87.5 percent in June 2017 to 82.8 percent same period this year. Gross margin rose to 17.2 percent by the end of the first half of 2018 compared with 12.5 percent in similar period in 2017. Further, net margin improved to 2.90 percent as against negative 0.10 percent in June last year. With a half year PAT of N8.5 billion, Oando has already realised 60 percent of the N13.5 billion PAT the company made at full year 2017, meaning that if the momentum is sustained, our projection shows it could make as much as N20 billion PAT by year end. In less than 24 hours after the results hit the market, Oando’s share price rose by 8.2 percent from N4.85 per share on July 26 to N5.25 per share last week Friday. This amounted to N4.97 billion increase as its market capitalisation which rose to N65.26 billion from N60.29 billion in just a day. Similarly, CCNN boosted its revenue by 42 percent during the period, as it realised N12.08 billion in H1 2018 in contrast to N8.5 billion same period last year. Gross profit rose by 81 percent to N5.5 billion from N3.03 billion during the reference period just as profit after tax increased by 153 percent from N1.03 billion at half year last year to N2.60 billion by June 2018. Gross margin improved to 45 percent to 36 percent during the period just as the profit margin increased from 12 percent to 22 percent within the same reference period. CCNN also succeeded in reducing the cost of goods sold relative to sales from 64 percent last June to 55 percent by June this year. It also reduced its finance costs by 61 percent from N78.6 million in June 2017 to N30.9 million same period this year. With this information at the disposal of both institutional and individual investors, which engendered increased demand for its shares, it share price rose by 10 percent within 24 hours to N31.35 per share on Friday from N28.5 per share on Thursday last week. CCNN’s market capitalisation closed last week at N39.40 billion up from N35.82 billion the previous day, translating to a gain of N3.58 billion in market capitalisation.
