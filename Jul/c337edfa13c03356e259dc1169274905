Adams Oshiomhole, the All Progressives Congress, APC National Chairman has denied the purported red card given to Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State by the party. Governor Ortom was Monday said to have announced that he is no longer with the APC as the party has issued him red card. “As for party, I’ve been given the red card and I’m now outside the pitch. So, if I have been given the red card and I’m standing outside, that means I’m a free man”, he stressed. But Oshiomhole told journalists in Abuja that, “I know that Governor Ortom is a very senior member of the party and he has said so repeatedly in print and has said to me one on one that he will not leave the APC unless he was pushed out. “I have since assumed chairmanship of this party along with my colleagues in the NWC and I know of a fact that we have not shut out any governor and certainly not governor Ortom”, he maintained.
