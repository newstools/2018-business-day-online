Sowemimo Abiodun Alex, the chief executive officer, Cvmetric Network Company has requested Nigeria’s government to commit substantial investment into Information and Communication Technology (ICT) as a way of alleviating poverty, creating wealth and employment opportunities for jobless Nigerians. The recent winner of Silicon Valley Nigeria Economic Development Award, declared that millions of youths that are jobless in the country could be gainfully employed if concerted efforts were deployed to unlock the great potentials in information technology that prompts youths building careers in the ICT sector. Alex, who is known for offering mentorship and ICT training to young entrepreneurs, said that innovations and structures were abound in the sector which are to be discovered and could fetch Nigerians and Nigeria millions of dollars in the long run if well implemented and undertaken. While urging all Nigerian youths to be technology- literate and utilise the hidden potentials offered by information and communication technology, Alex offered himself for training and mentoring of desired youths, saying “by so doing, you (Nigerian youths) will break new grounds and build a career in the IT world.” Dedicating the Silicon Valley award he won on ICT to Nigerian youths, he noted that availability of IT potentials and opportunities in Nigeria have not reached peak and therefore, needs much more commitments to invest more and unlock more opportunities, adding that in as much as IT drives economy in the world, Nigeria must not be an exemption. Alex said, “It’s a privilege to be honored by Silicon Valley Nigeria Economic Development. Not many people get this and being among the few people recognised in the Nigeria IT world is a great honour. “This award will be an encouragement for me to do more and to continually expand the scope of technology in Nigeria to alleviate social and corporate challenges.”  SIKIRAT SHEHU, Ilorin
