The federal government of Nigeria has unveiled Nigeria Air as the new national carrier. The new airline was unveiled at the Farnborough air show in England. Ethiopian Airlines Enterprise, Africa’s biggest airline, said it’s in discussions to back the Nigerian government’s plans for a new national carrier. Hadi Sirika, the minister of Aviation said he had earlier met with Standard Chartered Bank to discuss funding for the aircraft acquisition. But industry experts who reacted to the level of discussion with the aircraft manufacturing companies expressed reservation about the timeliness of the delivery of the equipment. They said that when aircraft are ordered the manufacturers need time to manufacture them. They noted that manufacturers do not keep aircraft on ground and sell them like cars but are produced for airlines and others that make firm order and back their order with payment for the aircraft. However, Sirika has not given details on how the airline would start operation after it has been unveiled but had earlier said that the new carrier would start with five aircraft that would be delivered on December 19, 2018.
