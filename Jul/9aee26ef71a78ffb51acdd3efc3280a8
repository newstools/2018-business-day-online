Konga has taken another step to address the issue of trust and guaranty satisfaction from customers who shop online, by launching Konga Compliance – a feedback/compliance mechanism through which customers can directly reach out to the chairman of the board and executive management of Konga on issues affecting various aspects of it business relationship with the customer. The e-commerce company says it pioneered the launch of a compliance platform in order to further uplift ethical standards in Africa’s e-commerce space and raise the bar in customer satisfaction which is a major concern for online shoppers. Apart from the online feedback platform, compliance@konga.com, Konga compliance will also incorporate a dedicated phone line for calls and SMSs. The company says that all feedbacks, complaints and enquiries generated on the email platform will be monitored directly by the chairman and other management executives for immediate resolution. As such, the platform will present a useful mechanism for customers to report errant drivers and delivery men who over-speed or flout traffic rules in the course of duty, wrong or improperly delivered items, product quality concerns, instances of poor customer service online or at any Konga retail store, collection center or touch-point, late deliveries, pass comments/suggestions on new product lines/innovations or likely improvements they would like to see and other issues affecting stipulated service level agreements or areas of compliance. Bearing in mind the need to lay a framework for its game-changing ideas and innovations for the e-commerce market, the new management at Konga has decided to institute a high level of ethical standards and compliance within the company which will not only boost user experience and satisfaction, but help create a closer bond between the company and its ever-increasing customer base. Konga says it is keen to revolutionize the e-commerce space in Nigeria and beyond – a factor that has seen the new management of the company work round the clock behind the scenes to put in the requisite structures and infrastructure needed to elevate standards in the sector. BusinessDay gathers that these initiatives which are set to be unveiled from early August will see the new Konga, which emerged after the merger with Yudala in May 2018, leverage its composite structure and fusion of online and offline to ensure an unprecedented level of world class customer experience, improved standards and growth in the Nigerian and African e-commerce eco-system. A business model that is hard to replicate in view of its considerable human and material resources requirements, Konga’s bold fusion of online and offline is one that has set it apart and contributed to its widespread and growing reputation as a trusted name for genuine products, secure payment options and unmatched speedy delivery timelines.
