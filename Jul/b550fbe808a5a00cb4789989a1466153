Style House Files (SHF) in collaboration with Nigerian Export Promotion Council (NEPC) partnered with OKAPI for a pop-up with Nkwo and GREY, and The Place London with AAKS and Lisa Folawiyo. Speaking on the collaboration, Hanneli Rupert, Director Okapi, and Merchants on Long said “Okapi is always excited to be able to work with other luxury brands from around the African Continent. Nigeria has such a wealth of talent and quality and yet like South Africa also sometimes struggles to get the exposure it needs in the global market so pop-ups like these are a great way to showcase what is available.” Simon Burstein commented, “Both Lisa Folawiyo and Akosua Afriyie-Kumi are world travelers, with great personal style and loves of fashion which transcends through their designs. This alchemy, combined with local craftsmanship, results in beautiful and exotic collections”. This season’s trade shows are sponsored by the Nigerian Export Promotion Council (NEPC) in collaboration with Style House Files(SHF). Nigeria Export Promotion Council (NEPC) remains at the forefront of championing the cause of Made in Nigeria apparel to thrive by providing a myriad of opportunities for capacity building and access to market.
