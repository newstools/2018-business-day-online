The year-to-date transaction of Nigeria’s autonomous foreign exchange market- the Investors and Exporters (I&E) Window, hits $31.14 billion (N11.2 trillion) as at week-ended July 13 2018. Market analysts linked the high transaction recorded in the window to Central Bank of Nigeria’s (CBN) periodic dollar interventions. “The central bank have helped in eliminating the pressure on the FX market, ensured exchange rate stability and eliminated currency speculators,” an analyst said on the condition of anonymity. The apex bank intervened through its periodic supply of United States (US) Dollars in the FX market, offering $100.00 million at a marginal rate of $/₦344.00 via a Single Secondary Market Intervention Sales (SMIS) – Wholesale session held during the week-ended July 13, 2018. The apex bank also maintained its intervention for Small and Medium-Scale Enterprises (SMEs) & Retail Invisible transactions supplying $55.00 million each for both interventions. Meanwhile, the total value of trades recorded in the I&E window for the week-ended July 6, 2018 stood at $0.86 billion. This represented an increase of 8.86 percent ($0.07 billion) when compared to the $0.79 billion traded in the previous week, bringing the total value traded at the Window year-to-date to $31.14 billion, as compiled from CBN website. The naira exchange rate has remained stable since last year when the central bank commenced the FX sales. The apex bank in Africa’s largest economy introduced a new exchange rate window in April 2017, the Nigerian Autonomous Foreign Exchange Fixing Mechanism (NAFEX), commonly known as the Investors’ and Exporters’ (I &E) window. The I&E window and the interbank market have been seen as the main exchange rate windows utilised in foreign currency trading. Meanwhile, for the week-ended July 13, 2018, the Naira appreciated at the I&E FX Window, gaining ₦1.42 to close at $/₦361.16 when compared to $/₦362.58 recorded the previous week, resulting in a spread of $/₦0.16 between the BDC market rate and I&E FX Window rate Also, Nigeria’s external reserves recently hit a five-year high of $46 billion, representing an increase of 18 per cent or $7 billion over the country’s reserves figure of $38.912 billion as of January, 2018. This has also surpassed the CBN $40 billion target for 2018 as announced by Godwin Emefiele, the CBN Governor, in November of 2017.
