Financials have been the major sector behind the rally in stocks over the past year. Despite the bruising equity prices have received this year, the All Share Index still has a one year return of +12.04 percent.  BusinessDay analysis showed that out of the top 10 biggest index movers during this period, 5 were banks. These banks were Stanbic IBTC (3rd), GTBank (4th), FBN Holdings (5th), Zenith Bank (6th) and Ecobank Transnational Inc (8th).  The five banks added a total of 2,355 points to the All Share Index (ASI) in the past year, more than any other group of companies on the top 10 list of index movers.  In the past year alone, share prices in these banks have accelerated dramatically off the back of strong earnings performance in FY 2017 and Q1 2018.Â  Shares in Stanbic IBTC rose 67.79 percent while FBNH rose 75.69 percent. Zenith, GTBank and ETI are up 20.22 percent, 15 percent and 46.85 percent respectively.  Although banks have outperformed other sectors on the index, the outsize index weights of Nestle and Dangote Cement which account for 38% of market capitalization on Nigeria Stock Exchange combined with their strong equity performance of 74.06 percent and 13.18 percent respectively ensured that both firms finished as 1st and 2nd biggest index movers over the past year.  Gains in Nestle moved the index up by around 1,513 points while gains in Dangote Cement added 1,430 points to the broad equity index.  Other firms who ranked among the top 10 index movers over the past year include Dangote Sugar (7th), Seplat (9th) and Unilever (10th). Their stocks are currently up 113.91 percent, 40.21 percent and 58.65 percent respectively in the past one year.  Out of the top 10 index movers, five are included in the banking index, 3 are in the consumer goods index and one each from the industrial index and oil and gas index.  The top 10 index movers currently account for 70 percent of market capitalization on NSE. The market rout this year has negatively affected all the big index movers as the year to date performance for the market giants ranged from -7.29% to +27.69%.  In the one year under review, all 10 stocks had a positive return with the least performing company rallying 13.18 percent versus year to date performance where three companies slumped to negative returns since year beginning and only 4 have managed to rally over 10 percent year to date.  The bearish market sentiment was worse in other parts of the market. Out of the bottom eight market laggards in the last one year, four are oil companies which include Total (159th), Oando (160th), 11 plc (161st) and Forte oil (162nd) among 165 publicly traded companies surveyed using data compiled from Bloomberg. The oil companies pulled the index lower by -285 points over the past year.  The bottom three market laggards include Intercontinental Breweries (163rd), Lafarge Africa (164th) and Nigerian Breweries (165th). Nigerian Breweries in particular is responsible for a drop of around -883 points on the All Share Index during the one year period which was the highest by any firm on the index. NB is the 4th largest company (by market capitalisation) on NSE so when the stock performs poorly, it typically drags the overall market performance.
Stifling competition in the brewery space is most probably responsible for the poor performance of the brewery companies during the past year.  If the other sectors like FCMG, Oil marketing and Manufacturing do not pull their weights around boosting their equity performance this year, the market may once again have to rely on banks to pull the market higher again in 2018.
