Mario Mandzukic became the first player in 40 years to score both a goal and an own goal during one FIFA World Cup match on Sunday. The Croatia forward scored an own goal after he diverted Antoine Griezmannâ€™s free kick into his own net in the 18th minute, and capitalized on a poor error from France goalkeeper Hugo Lloris and tapped the ball into an empty net in the 69th minute as France beat Croatia 4-2 and won their second World Cup after winning their first in 1998 on home soil. Croatia were appearing for the first time in a World Cup final. Before today, Netherlands player Ernie Brandts was the only player to have scored for both teams in a match. He scored an own goal for Italy and later a goal for his country in their 2-1 win on June 21, 1978.
