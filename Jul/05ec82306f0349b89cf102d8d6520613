Governor Ibikunle Amosun of Ogun state has confirmed the inauguration of $250 million International Breweries plant located at Sagamu interchange in Obafemi-Owode local government area of the state by President Muhammadu Buhari next month. The plant, which will be the largest brewery plant of International Breweries PLC in West and East Africa, having merged three existing breweries in Nigeria – International Breweries, Ilesa, Osun state; Intafact Beverages, Onitsha, Anambra state and Pabod Breweries, Port Harcourt, Rivers state, is a subsidiary of Belgian-Brazilian Breweries – AB InBev. Speaking during International Breweries PLC management’s courtesy visit to the Governor’s Office recently, Amosun noted the actualization and inauguration of manufacturing plants such as International Breweries plant in Ogun state was borne out of tireless efforts of government to make the state conducive for investments and entrepreneurship. While commending International Breweries PLC for locating its biggest plant in West and East Africa to Ogun state, the governor requested the company to source a larger percentage of its Rae materials locally and offer employment opportunities to indigenes, saying concerted effort should also be made to engage in corporate social responsibility. Responding, Annabelle Degroot, managing director of International Breweries PLC, declared huge economic opportunities would be offered not only for Ogun state and its people but the Nigerians at large as a larger percentage of brewing raw materials such as maize, sorghum, cassava, bottles, packaging, and labelling materials, among others, would be sourced locally. BusinessDay reports that operations and brewing of lager beers such as Hero, Trophy, Castle Lite, Hero, Eagle, Budweiser as well as Pabod and Beta malt, among other drinks have begun ahead of the inauguration of the plant by President Buhari in August as efforts are ongoing to have clusters of farmers that supply major raw materials for the brewery.
