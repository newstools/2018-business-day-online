Emeka Stanley, former deputy speaker of the Abia State House of Assembly and an aspirant for the Abia South Senatorial seat has said that equity demands that it is the time of Ukwa people to occupy the Red Chamber of the National Assembly for Abia South senatorial District being presently occupied by Enyinnaya Abaribe. While speaking with journalists in Umuahia, Stanley said although Abaribe has done well at the upper chamber on issues concerning the Igbos, that such should not be used as a yardstick to re-elect the three term senator in 2019. “Though I thump up for Enyi Abaribe, the incumbent occupier of Abia South senatorial seat at the Senate, but after 12 years at the upper chamber, our vocal senator should give opportunity for others and take a position of a consultant, adviser and father of all,” he said. The former member of the Federal House Representatives for Ukwa East/Ukwa West Federal constituency dismissed the insinuation held in some quarters that the position of a lawmaker is tenureless as obtained in the United States and other Western climes, adding that Nigerian democracy is still nascent and should not be compared to countries that have practised it for over 200 years. He said that opportunity should be given to others to contribute their quota to the development of the country. “If such practice has been the norm, the likes of Abaribe would not have occupied the Red Chamber of the National Assembly as the former occupier Adolf Wabara would not have respected the understanding for rotation between the two political blocs and the need for injection of new ideas,” Stanley said. He disclosed that his quest for the seat was anchored on equity and social justice for his Ukwa people, adding that the Ngwa nation in the same socio-political alliance with Ukwa had produced four out of five senators which the zone had produced in the nation’s democratic experience, leaving Ukwa with only one (Wabara) who did only two terms. The National Assembly aspirant further hinted that their senior brother in the alliance (Ngwa) had produced five deputy governors and now a governor, thereby marginalising them (Ukwa) He maintained that no matter what should be seen as the numerical strength of Ukwa Nation, they remained an entity that should be recognised and that their due privileges and rights accorded them which are what equity and social justice are all about and as enshrined in the constitution of the country. He noted that his Ukwa people have been marginalised when it comes to sharing of political positions between the Ngwa and Ukwa and insisted that Ngwa people must concede this time around.
