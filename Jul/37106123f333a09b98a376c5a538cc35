Members of Edo State chapter of People’s Democratic Party (PDP on Thursday staged a peaceful protest in reaction to the alleged attack on the governor of Ekiti State, Ayodele Fayose, by security personnel. The party faithfuls, who were at the premises of the Edo State secretariat of the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ), also marched to the headquarters of the state command of the Nigeria police to register their displeasure over the incident. The publicity secretary of the party, Chris Nehikhare, who led the protest, described the attacked on the sitting governor by the security agents as undemocratic and lacked respect for constituted authority. “PDP in Edo State condemn in strong terms attempt by security agents loyal to the ruling APC-led Federal Government to rig and write results for Saturday’s Ekiti State governorship election. Nigerians want a free and fair election, and not war,” he said. Nehikhare, who said PDP was in solidarity with the good people of Ekiti State, particularly the PDP members, also sympathised with Nigerians for having such a “despotic government” in power that had now turned state power to power of tyranny and that of terrorism. The party, who vowed to resist any attempt to rig and write results in favour of a particular political party and its candidate, said the party as a family believes in the rule of law and wants a free, fair election and not war. While decrying the deployment of heavily armed security personnel including over 30,000 policemen to Ekiti State, he noted that the motive behind the heavy security presence was to create unnecessary tension as well as to intimidate voters. He also lamented that in spite of the numbers of security personnel in the country, people were being killed on a daily basis in states like Sokoto, Plateau, Taraba, Benue, Zamfara, Adamawa, among others.
