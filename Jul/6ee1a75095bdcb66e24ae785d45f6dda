Roma are considering whether to take legal action after missing out on the signing of Bordeaux’s Brazilian winger Malcom to Barcelona. The Catalan club announced on Tuesday night they had agreed the 42million euros (£37.3million) signing of the 21-year-old, just a day after Roma said they had a deal of their own. Malcom, who was also linked with Everton and Inter Milan, has agreed a five-year contract at the Nou Camp and has passed his medical on Wednesday. The signing could have implications on Barca’s reported pursuit of Chelsea’s Willian. “We are looking at our options and seeing if we have a legal case,” Roma sporting director Monchi said on the club website. “It is true that nothing was signed, but there are many messages with the agents and their president that are at least worth being assessed.” Monchi said Roma only, and reluctantly, went public with the deal on Monday after he received a phone call from Bordeaux president Stephane Martin telling him the French side were going to make an official announcement because of rumours surrounding the transfer. Monchi claimed Bordeaux then reneged on their 40million euros (£35.5million) deal with Roma, the result of “three of four days of intensive negotiations”, after receiving the higher offer from Barcelona.
