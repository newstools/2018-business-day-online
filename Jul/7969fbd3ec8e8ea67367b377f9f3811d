The joint taskforce set up by the Lagos State Government comprising the police, military personnel and Lagos State Traffic Management Authority (LASTMA) has moved trucks off the access roads to Apapa and its environs. Hassan Mahmud, the public affairs officer of LASTMA, who confirmed this to BusinessDay on Saturday, said some trucks indiscriminately parked on the Mile 2-Tincan axis as well as others on Ijora-Apapa bridge were removed from the roads. He did not, however, disclose the number of trucks towed by the joint taskforce. Mahmud said the taskforce moved into the Apapa axis midnight on Friday, and worked till early this morning to restore sanity to the chaotic traffic situation in the area. “Lagos State as a responsible government couldn’t continue to sit and watch some individuals doing their private businesses hold the state and other citizens to ransom. The taskforce worked tirelessly through the night to create access into Apapa. As I am speaking to you, the roads to Apapa are free. People can drive to into Apapa via Tincan and Ijora without hindrances. The taskforce worked together with the leadership of the various unions in the sector, including Petroleum Tanker Drivers (PTD) and Nigerian Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers, (NUPENG),” said Mahmud. Imohimi Edgal, the Commissioner of Police (CP) in Lagos State, had while announcing the constitution of the taskforce after a crucial meeting of stakeholders, on Wednesday, said over 100 armed policemen supported by other security agencies, would be deployed to the roads to restore sanity. Apapa and its environs have been on a lockdown since the beginning of the week due to the occupation of major access roads by thousands of petroleum tankers and container carrying trucks. Residents of the area and businesses had been shut in, just as commuters resorted to trekking long distances to and fro work. JOSHUA BASSEY
