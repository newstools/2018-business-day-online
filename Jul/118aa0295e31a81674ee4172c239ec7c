Following the exciting 64 matches of the 2018 FIFA World Cup, FIFA has invited the head coaches and technical directors of all 211 member associations, as well as the technical experts of all six confederations, to the FIFA Football Conference to be held on 23 September 2018 in London, the birthplace of the modern game. The purpose of the conference is to analyse FIFA’s flagship competition from a technical and tactical point of view, identify trends and compare the main findings with previous editions of the FIFA World Cup based on the report by FIFA’s Technical Study Group (TSG), which is due to be presented at the conference. The event will also comprise discussions about the implementation of VAR and its impact on the game. Unlike the Post-FIFA World Cup Conferences organised by FIFA after Brazil 2014 and South Africa 2010, based on the FIFA 2.0 vision, which aims to promote an enhanced dialogue with member associations and confederations at all levels, a single event for all FIFA member associations is being organised for the first time. Besides the FIFA Football Conference, individual meetings with the technical experts of the confederations and member associations are planned. “The 2018 FIFA World Cup was a huge success on and off the pitch. Through this conference, we aim to present and discuss the main findings identified on the pitch by our experts while listening to the feedback from our member associations. The World Cup should be seen as a learning platform that could have a positive impact on football’s technical development around the world. By having a single conference, we can engage with all our member associations at once and trigger a rich and diverse football dialogue,” says FIFA Deputy Secretary General (Football) Zvonimir Boban. The FIFA Football Conference will take place on the eve of The Best FIFA Football Awards.
