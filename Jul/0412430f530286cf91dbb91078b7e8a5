The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that to achieve the aim, NNPC has signed Utilisation and Units Operating Agreements (UUOA) with seven oil and gas companies to bridged the shortfall. He said there was need for Nigeria to be the regional hub for gas-based industries such as fertizer, methanol, LPG and ensure a high value gas export through regional gas pipelines. He said the workshop, which was one of the high points in NNPC journey, was to stimulate unprecedented economic growth through the pursuit of aggressive gas development. He explained that the issue of inadequate gas supply for domestic market had been on for several years, and that the workshop marked a major milestone in the quest to bridge that shortfall. The NNPC chief said the corporation had engaged two world class project management consultants (DeltaAfrik/Worley Parson and Crestech/Penspen) to work with NPDC and NNPC JV Partners to achieve the set goals. He added that the NNPC project management groups would strengthen their oversight functions on the seven projects by ensuring prompt decision making and timely approvals in line with international best practices.
