Investors are bidding stocks higher after a flurry of positive half year corporate earnings by Nigerian companies last week helped the stock market climb by 0.58 percent Friday.
Among the companies that posted impressive half-year earnings last week include Glaxo Smith Kline (GSK), First City Monument Bank (FCMB), Cement Company of Northern Nigeria (CCNN), Fidson healthcare and 11 plc (Mobil).
Other companies that posted profit last week were Dangote Cement, Okomu Plc, Transnational Corporation of Nigeria and Dangote Sugar. The flurry of positive half year earnings comes at a time where a long standing sell-off, triggered by political uncertainty ahead of the 2019 Nigeria elections and rate hikes in the United States, have pushed the market to a negative return of 4 percent year to date.
“Despite the continued sell-off in the equities market in recent times, we believe this presents decent entry opportunities in our quality names,” Investment One said in a research note to clients Friday. “Furthermore, we could see investors take position in anticipation of the release of H1 2018 results and possible corporate action,” the financial advisory firm noted.
The local unit of Diageo Plc, Guinness, jumped 10 percent Friday, the most since September, with trade volume 63 percent the three-month daily average, as investors believe the parent company’s positive results will run off on Guinness Nigeria.
Cement maker, CCNN, also gained 10 percent Friday, after its financial results published same day showed a 155 percent jump in net profit to N2.6 billion from N1.02 billion.
11plc, formerly known as Mobil, saw profit after tax rise 120 percent to N5.4 billion in the first half of 2018 from N2.5 billion in the same period of 2017. 11plc’s share price was unchanged at N180. Fidson healthcare also recorded a jump in net profit, following an 11.8 percent rise to N521 million in H1 2018 from N466 million in H1 2017, while revenue was up 10 percent to N7.4 billion from N6.7 billion. Fidson shares were unchanged at the close of trading. GSK also saw profit rise 16 times to more than the N21.7 billion recorded in the first half of 2017 to N362 billion in the first half of 2018.
Dangote Cement, the market’s most capitalised company, also saw a 3.1 percent growth in bottom line to N113 billion in the first half of 2018 from N109.7 billion, while its revenue climbed to N482.4 billion, up 16 pc from N412.7 billion.
Also, Transnational Corporation of Nigeria Plc’s PAT rose 161.2 percent to N10.9 billion from N4.2 billion, as revenue from its power operations climbed. Meanwhile, FCMB’s PAT nearly doubled to N5.7 billion in H1 2018 from N3.018 billion.
Transcorp’s share price rose 3.39 percent to N1.2 per share Friday, while FCMB gained 3.55 percent to N2.04. Dangote Sugar and Okomu Oil posted net profits of N12.7 billion and N6.0 billion respectively. At market close on Friday, the Consumer Goods Index gained 1.05 percent, largely driven by Dangote Sugar which was up 10.00 percent.
The Banking index also closed up by 0.78 percent, while the Industrial index increased by 0.43 percent, following the buy interests in CCNN.
The All Share Index (ASI) was up by 209.75 absolute points, closing at 36,636.97 points. Similarly, the market capitalization increased by N75.98 billion to N13.27 trillion.
“The relatively attractive prices at which counters are trading spurred buying pressure and we expect the release of financial scorecards to continue to drive positive investor sentiment on counters in the market,” said analysts at Lagos-based financial advisory, Meristem, in a note to clients.
