The Nigeria U15 National Team, nicknamed Future Eagles, has been drawn to play Morocco, Djibouti and Libya in the football tournament of the 3rd African Youth Games that commenced in Algiers on Thursday. The draw held on Wednesday put the Future Eagles in the same pool as Morocco, with whom the Nigerian boys were involved a two â€“match friendly fair in Marrakech in August 2017. Morocco won the first game 1-0 with the other match tied 1-1. The Future Eagles and their Moroccan counterparts face off on Thursday, before the Nigerians take on Djibouti on Saturday and Libya on Monday. Nigeria did not participate in the football event of the first African Youth Games in Rabat but won four out of five matches, drawing the other to emerge winners of the football gold at the second edition in Gaborone, Botswana four years ago.
