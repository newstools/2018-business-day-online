Former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, has praised the President of the Senate, Bukola Saraki for having the courage to dump the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) stressing that lawmaker has endured prolonged but malicious treatment from the APC. Atiku made this known in a statement he issued on Tuesday through his media aide, Mazi Paul Ibe, saying he was gladdened by the news of the defection of the President of the Senate, pointing out that the APC has shown so much disdain for Saraki as the number three citizen the same way the APC has disregarded the country. “Senator Saraki’s ordeal at the hand of the All Progressives Congress is all too familiar to lovers of democracy in Nigeria and around the world. Leaving a party which maliciously prosecuted him and subjected him to the most degrading treatment, notwithstanding his status as the nation’s number three citizen, took courage, and I commend him. “What the APC did to Senator Saraki is what they have also done to Nigeria as a nation. They have degraded our democracy and our economy,” Atiku said. The former Vice President noted that Bukola Saraki is a product of the Peoples Democratic Party, (PDP) under whose banner he became a Presidential Adviser, Governor and Senator. He added that the PDP’s ideology and political philosophy is conducive to Senator Saraki’s political leaning. “I therefore not only welcome Senator Saraki’s resignation from the APC, I also urge him to go one step further and join the only party capable of enshrining genuine democracy in Nigeria as well as lasting economic progress. I urge Senator Saraki to join our great party, the Peoples Democratic Party,” Atiku said. Saraki on Tuesday announced that he had dumped the APC alleging that the party had in the last three years subjected him to persecution and ridicule. He said in a statement on Tuesday that his decision was reached after due consultations with important stakeholders.  Innocent Odoh, Abuja
