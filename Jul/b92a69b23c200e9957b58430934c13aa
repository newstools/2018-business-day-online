The market attained a five-year high in January when it peaked at 45,321.82 basis points, Since then, the NSE’s benchmark All-Share index has seen a downtrend, due to continued sell-offs resulting from profit taking, investor reactions to the interest rate hike in the U.S, as well political uncertainties ahead of the nation’s 2019 general elections.
Data compiled by BusinessDay shows that Nigerian Breweries Plc, Larfarge Africa Plc, International Breweries, Union Bank Plc, Forte Oil Plc and PZ Cussons Nigeria PLC were the major drag on the NSE-ASI index to its 8month low at the close of the trading session yesterday.

“We expect the sell-off to intensify as we approach the 2019 general elections. Nevertheless, we may see the downtrend taper slightly by the end of this month if the H1:2018 scorecards exceed analyst’s expectation,” said Ayodeji Ebo MD/CEO at Lagos-based Afrivest securities limited.
“However, we anticipate more interest from domestic retail and institutional investors who understand the political terrain better by taking advantage of cheaper valuations in the fourth quarter,” Ebo said in an emailed response to BusinessDay.
