Madiba’s House, a non-profit organisation dedicated solely to promoting the leadership principles, philosophies and qualities of the late icon, Dr. Nelson Mandela, aims to spearhead one million tweets on July 18, 2018, in honour of the late icon.
July 18, which happens to be Nelson Mandela International Day (or Mandela Day), as declared by the United Nations since 2009, is a day set aside to honour the legacy of Nelson Mandela.
Madiba’s House is targeting one million tweets on Mandela Day this year to acquaint people of the leadership qualities and principles of the late Nelson Mandela, especially the young people of Africa where there is a seeming dearth of leadership.
“It is our way of remembering the great man who affected the lives of millions of people not only in his native South Africa but also around the world,” Kirk Leigh, founder of Madiba’s House, says. It is also a way of announcing our presence on the scene having played small since our founding in 2011.We encourage everyone who can to make a tweet on Mandela on July 18”. He concludes.
Madiba’s House has, since 2012 been teaching 18 leadership principles of Nelson Mandela in scores of schools in at least three local government areas of Lagos State. Developed between 2010 and 2011, the Madiba Leadership. Principles (MLP) have been the focus and founding philosophy of Madiba’s House whose mission is to reach 20,000 people with the MLP.
The organisation is soliciting tweets from all over the world that extol the leadership qualities of Nelson Mandela. The hashtags for the tweets are #tweet4mandela and #madibashouse.
This year’s Mandela Day celebration will mark 100 years since the birth of Nelson Mandela. The centenary is an occasion to reflect Mandela’s life and legacy and follow his call to make the world a better place.
