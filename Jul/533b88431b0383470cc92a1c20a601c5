FBN Holdings Plc, Nigeria’s second largest bank by assets says it expects its non-performing loans (NPL) ratio to decline to less than 15 percent by year-end from 20.8 percent as at the half year 2018 period, due to credit restructuring and recovery.
The Lagos-based lender is looking to target manufacturing, trade and retail-distribution companies for loans this year, according to Urum Kalu Eke, the Chief Executive Officer and Group Managing Director at FBN Holdings who was speaking on a teleconference call yesterday with analysts and investors on the unaudited results for the six months 30 June 2018 period.
“Loan-growth target has been cut to 5%-7% from 7%-10%, after payments by borrowers and delays in approving new loans,” Eke said.
Meanwhile FBN is expected to make a 35 percent provision on its loan to 9mobile Nigeria and a 30 percent provision on credit to Atlantic Energy, according to its Chief Risk Officer Olusegun Alebiosu.
“The resolution of the 9mobile debt is expected in 3Q; while the Atlantic Energy resolution will happen this year,” said Alebiosu on the same conference call.
