In real terms, consumer spending fell year-on-year by around -0.99 percent in 2017 despite an 11.14 percent increase in employee compensation during the year according to the data compiled from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).
Household spending behaviour in 2017 was contrary to economistsâ€™ expectation and conventional wisdom. One will expect that in a year when the economic growth rebounded from negative territory thereby boosting real wages in the country, consumer spending will increase significantly, however the complete opposite occurred.
BusinessDay found out that real wages started to pick up even before the economy pulled out of the recession in Q2 2017. Real wages increased by around 7.56 percent and 14.17 percent in Q1 and Q2 2017, respectively while national output on the other hand fell by -0.91 in the Q1 2017 before increasing by 0.72 percent in Q2.
The growth in real wages in 2017 also made it the first positive year-on-year annual growth recorded in Nigeria since 2015.
Consumer spending which had positive growth in the first (5.41%) and second (0.97%) quarter fell significantly by around -11.88 percent in Q3. This gigantic drop in Q3 was directly responsible for the full year drop in consumer spending at year end 2017 as all other quarters of the year delivered positive growth.
Ayodele Akinwunmi, Head of Research and Strategy, FSDH Merchant Bank explained that the decline in consumer spending could be as a result of lagged effects of the economic recession as well as seasonal effects that could have caused the massive decline in consumer spending in Q3.
Henry Ogbuaku, Group Head, Asset Management, GDL told BusinessDay by phone that consumer spending is also dependent on the budget. The delayed implementation of the budget and release of funds could have impacted negatively on consumer spending. Omobola Adu & Emeka Ucheaga
