Ayeyemi said “We were encouraged with the levels of client activity we saw in most of our businesses and precisely in our deposit-generating franchise. As a result, customer deposits grew 12percent in constant currency, improving the firm’s liquidity and ability to lend to customers. The enormous efforts we have made to improve asset quality is also paying off. We have started to see improvements in our credit portfolio, resulting in lower impairment losses for the period”. “Finally, on 14 June, we announced intended meetings with global fixed-income investors, following which, if market conditions permitted, would result in a 5-year USD denominated senior unsecured bond offering. Despite positive investor meetings, market conditions were less benign, driven by the confluence of interest rate rises in the US and sell-off in emerging market debt. As a result we have held off on the offering until such a period when conditions will improve.”
