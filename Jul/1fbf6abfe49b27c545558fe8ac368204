Sterling Bank has started a tweeter conflict with other Nigeria’s commercial banks as each banks are now taking turns to swipe at each other on Twitter with many Nigerians enjoying the fun side of the chit chat. The clash started late Friday when Sterling Bank posted a tweet which had a graphic illustration of a bank customer on a space ship shooting for the moon with a Sterling Bank logo.   The graphic also included a boy slaking on a board with what seemed like an Access Bank board. It also had somebody looking out of a window of a cube looking house with a color related to GTB while two boys each rode on an elephant and horse respectively in subtle shade to First Bank and Union Bank respectively. Sterling Bank reaction “Shoot for the moon, become a star – it’s the least you deserve”. Welcome to #SterlingBank pic.twitter.com/Jt7M5AkSSb   — Sterling Bank Plc (@Sterling_Bankng) July 20, 2018.
