The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has welcomed the defection of Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom, to its fold. Reacting to Wednesday’s defection of Ortom from APC to PDP, National Publicity Secretary of PDP, Kola Ologbondiyan, commended the Governor for standing by his people. It said his return is a reflection of his people’s desires, further confirms the rejection of the Buhari-led APC administration by Nigerians. In a statement by the party’s spokesperson, Ologbondiyan said: “The return of the Governor to PDP confirms the fact that President Muhammadu Buhari’s led-administration and the All Progressives Congress (APC) do not have the welfare of Nigerians at heart, as they have continually offered flimsy excuses over the mindless killings that have caused untold sorrows across the country, particularly, Benue State. “PDP recalls that the Buhari-led federal government has failed in its basic responsibility of protecting live, property, territorial integrity of our nation. “Painfully, Nigerians are being slaughtered in Benue, Taraba, Plateau, Kaduna, Zamfara, Sokoto, nearly on daily basis. “The party also recall how the APC-led Buhari administration, would rather plead for the accomodation of persons whom have been repeatedly fingered as being responsible for heinous killings in the Benue valley rather than take decisive and concrete actions to preserve lives of Nigerians. “It also buttresses the fact that PDP remains the viable platform for all Nigerians that are desirous of rescuing our nation from the gross misgovernance and authoritarianism exhibited by the APC-led adminisration”.
