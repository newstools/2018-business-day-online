Royal Exchange Nigeria Plc has returned to profit, thanks to improvement in premium incomes as the insurer’s innovative products continue to contribute to revenue. For the first three months through March 2018, Royal Exchange recorded profit after tax of N389.91 million from a loss of N237.37 million the previous year when economic downturns undermine earnings. The growth at the bottom line (profit) was largely driven by an increase in premium income. Gross premium written (GPW) increased by 10 percent to N7.67 billion in March 2018 from N6.97 billion the previous year. Gross premium income increased by 13.33 percent to N3.51 billion in the period under review as against N3.40 billion the previous year. Net premium written (NPI) was up 34.80 percent to N2.44 billion in March 2018 compared to N1.81 billion recorded the previous year. The Nigerian insurer recorded a positive real underwriting performance of N933.10 million in the period under review while underwriting profit increased by 63.42 percent to N1.23 billion in March 2018 from N752.66 million the previous year. The real underwriting profit is calculated by subtracting 1 from combined ratios and multiplying the result by 100 while underwriting profit is arrived at by deducting net premium income from claims. However, Royal Exchange’s investment income, which comprise of income from short term government securities, bonds, and real estate, was down by 50.80 percent to N195.12 million from N384.71 million the previous year. Insurance firms in Africa’s largest economy are not taking advantage of the high yields environment. Experts are of the view that poor investment portfolio management is responsible for the insurance industry’s low performance compared to other sectors. They however added that an efficient investment management strategy will bolster insurer’s margins in the short term since an unpredictable and tough macroeconomic environment has undermined underwriting business. Agusto & Co estimated that the insurance industry’s investment portfolio grew by eight per cent to N762 billion in 2017 (approximately 75 percent of total assets). A breakdown of the industry’s investment portfolio showed a 44 per cent allocation to government securities, 18 per cent in bank placements & deposits, 16 per cent in real estate, seven per cent in subsidiaries and six per cent each in quoted and unquoted investments. “Despite growth in the industry’s investment portfolio, a rise in yields and significant investments in treasury bills, the average returns on investments remained below 10 per cent,” said analysts at Augusto and Co.
