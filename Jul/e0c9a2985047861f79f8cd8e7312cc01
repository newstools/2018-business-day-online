The first five months of the year have witnessed a bearish market, with foreign investors closing out their positions in large quantities. The month of May saw an outflow of N130 billion the largest so far in 6 years amidst the dwindling inflow of foreign portfolio investment (FPI). The recent report from Nigeria Stock Exchange (NSE), on the FPI for the year 2018 shows a constant reduction in foreign investment from 91.75 Billion at the start of the year to N62.06 Billion at the end of May. With inflows falling shot on outflows year to date, the month of May came with a surge as it saw an outflow of N130.89 billion which represent a 125 percent increase when compared with N58.25 billion outflows the previous month April. Speaking on this Mr Ayodeji Ebo, Managing Director at Afrinvest Securities Limited, said that this selloffs was in line with the current situation among emerging economies and not just in Nigeria as yields increases in the United State (US) fixed income and foreign investors wanting to reduce their exposure. When compared with other years as far back as the reports available on the NSE website, it was seen to be the largest single outflow in a single month representing 26 percent of the total trade carried out by both foreign and domestic investors that month. Foreign transactions also increased by 57.47% from N122.53 billion to N192.95 billion from April to May, outperforming domestic investors by 21.25% in May 2018. Total domestic transactions increased by 39.71% from N89.70 billion in April to N125.32 billion in May 2018. Furthermore, when comparing the cash flows of the first five months of the years from 2013 to 2018, it was discovered that the year 2018 has the highest negative withdrawals of N31.92 billion and also became the second highest net outflow in a single month at N68.06 billion behind March 2017 which saw a net outflow of N85.23 billion. Ayodele Akinwunmi, head of research and strategy at FSDH Merchant Bank Ltd, opines that the outflow of FPI was as a result of the low yield experience that month, coupled with the expectation of further hikes in the US rates and other developed countries, its normal that investors would want to weigh their options are go for the best. Going forward, as we approach the election year and a stronger US economy, We may see more investors wanting to reduce their exposure, close their position and repatriate their gains to an environment they perceived safer Ayodeji added.
