Former Vice President and frontline PDP presidential aspirant, Atiku Abubakar has said that his commitment to the promotion of democracy and good governance, is borne out of his belief that Nigeria must evolve through the ethos of participatory politics to be a competitive nation of the future. The former Vice President made this remarks in Lagos on Wednesday, during the launching of a book titled “Fighting Lions”, authored by renowned journalist and politician, Dele Momodu, a statement issued by the Atiku Campaign Organization said on Thursday. The launch of the book is in posthumous honour of the late winner of the June 12 presidential election, Chief MKO Abiola. Atiku, who was represented at the event by the former governorship candidate of the PDP in Lagos State, Jimi Agbaje similarly called on Nigerians from all walks of life to stand strong and be counted in the struggle to sustain democratic due diligence, rule of law and fundamental human rights stressing that  “those are the values that will strengthen the country in the future.” He paid tribute to Dele Momodu, for his courage and bravery in capturing and preserving contemporary history of  national socio-political activities for the benefit of generations unborn. Remarking on the decision of the author to commit his experiences with late MKO Abiola into a literature, Atiku noted that the title of the book, ‘Fighting Lions’ actually rings a bell and resonates with his entire political life, which has been fraught with ups and downs, the statement added. “To be candid, some of us who have experienced the good and bad sides of politics must endeavour to put pen to paper and document our thoughts in order to add to the body of human knowledge. However, Nigerians should not despair in the face of oppression and intimidation. Rather, all must work together to defend the sacred tenets of democracy, equity and social justice,” he said.
