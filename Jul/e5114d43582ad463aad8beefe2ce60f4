Shell Nigeria’s ambition to fully divest from onshore fields in Nigeria is nearing a critical stage as it is making significant progress to sell all its mining leases in the contentious Ogoni community.
Drilling for crude oil in onshore fields in Nigeria’s Niger Delta is fraught with challenges as oil assets are easily targeted by disgruntled elements.
Analysts say the company’s plan to fully exit onshore fields in Nigeria by divesting these assets to Nigerians is a good strategy.
“The risk of militancy and sabotage of oil assets is making Shell wary of investing in onshore fields in the Niger Delta, it makes better economic sense for them to divest these assets to Nigerian firms who have proven better adept at managing local crises than the IOCs,” said Chuks Nwani, an energy lawyer.
Nwani said that the IOCs are restricted by mandatory disclosures and have a difficult task explaining strange expenses from Nigeria when host communities begin to make incredulous demands.
Shell in April this year ramped up efforts and succeeded in renewing 17 of its oil leases due for renewal in 2019.
The 17 acreages are: OMLs 11, 17, 20, 21, 22, 23, 25, 27, 28 31, 32, 33, 35, 36, 43, 45 and 46. The properties were due to expire in 2019.
Recall that in April, the Ministry of Petroleum approved the recommendation by the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR), to revoke three Oil Mining Leases (OMLs) 31, 33 and 36, operated by Shell Petroleum Development Company, a local arm of Shell, the Anglo Dutch major.
While licences for 13 of the remaining 14 leases were renewed, the DPR proposed that OML 11 be split into three because it is too large at 2,800sq km. Those renewed have a new lease of life for another 20 years and analysts say the company will push for more divestments in in the coming months as it seeks to consolidate its operations.
Top on the asset disposal list are oil mining licenses 11 and 17 which Shell is considering selling for up to $2 billion, according to reports. Exiting the two blocks would cut Shell’s exposure in a crises prone region rife with controversy. “There is also the issue of uncertainties in the sector, so the best course of action is to hedge your risk,” Nwani said.
Meanwhile oil headed for a third weekly loss amid concern escalating trade rows would undercut energy demand, undermining reassurances from Saudi Arabia that it won’t flood global crude markets.
Futures pared gains in New York on Friday as President Donald Trump said that he’s “ready to go” with tariffs on $500 billion of Chinese goods. Crude has retreated about 6 percent this month as the escalating trade war between the U.S. and China rattled global financial markets.
Brent for September settlement rose 22 cents to $72.80 on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The contract fell 3.4 percent last week.
Since 2010, Shell has divested at least 12 oil assets in onshore Nigeria following intractable differences with host communities which often leads to destruction of the company’s assets.
In 2010, the company sold its interest in OML 4, 38 and 41. It soon followed with divestments of OML 26 and 42 which sold on Nov. 30, 2011; OML 40 on Aug. 31, 2012; OML 34 on Sept. 5, 2012 and OML 30 on Nov. 9, 2012, respectively.
The OMLs divested in the Eastern Niger Delta region are 26, 30, 34, 40, 42, 4, 41and 38. In June 2013, Shell also announced a strategic review of its operations in the Eastern Niger Delta and this culminated in the divestment of OMLs 18, 24, 25, 29 and the Nembe Creek Trunk Line.
Nigeria is yet to pass a petroleum industry bill since a decade which is a chief course of uncertainty in the sector. Operators are also calling for concrete policy on fiscal terms for the sector.  ISAAC ANYAOGU
