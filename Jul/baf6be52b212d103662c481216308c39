Former governor of Lagos State and national leader of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) has finally given his endorsement to the second term bid of incumbent Governor Akinwunmi Ambode. With the coast now clear, Ambode is expected soon to officially declare his intention to seek re-election in the 2019 poll. Incumbent governor of Osun State, Rauf Aregbesola, it was learnt through the mandate group of the APC, had been working clandestinely to prevail on Tinubu to frustrate Ambode’s bid. It was gathered that the Oba of Lagos, Rilwan Akiolu, and other chieftains of the APC from Abuja, worked tirelessly to make Tinubu see reason why  Ambode deserves the party’s ticket, as the primaries draw closer. “The APC leader will openly endorse Ambode for second term any moment from now,” a source said on Wednesday. Among others, the APC factional leader,  Fouad Oki, had confirmed Aregbesola’s subtle plan to stop Ambode’s re-election, alleging that the Osun State governor had been meeting political groups to stop Ambode’s return. Although this had been debunked by Sola Fasure, one of Aregbesola’s aides. It was gathered that Tinubu was prevail upon to reward Ambode’s loyalty. Ambode has been very loyalty to the party and Asiwaju, he deserves to be rewarded
He has never fought back despite all allegations and attacks against him.” “Rather, he allowed reasons and truth to prevail. He presented his case to Tinubu. Unlike his immediate predecessor,  Babatunde Fashola, Ambode never allowed the plot to destroy his long time relationship with Asiwaju, said a source.
