A presidential aspirant under the Kowa Party (KP), Tope Adefemiwa, has disclosed that the current opposition coalition in the country must present a credible presidential candidate for it to stand any chance of defeating incumbent President Muhammadu Buhari in next year’s presidential election. Adefemiwa, who spoke in an interview with BusinessDay, advocated for a youthful presidential candidate who has no record of corruption charges, stressing that such a candidate should rekindle confidence in Nigerians on the opposition alliance for the 2019 general elections “We must set out to present a sellable personality as the flag-bearer for the Coalition of United Political Parties (CUPP) for the 2019 presidential elections. This will be a testament that this merger means well for Nigerians, both at home and in the Diaspora” “The need for a youthful, intelligent and incorruptible flag-bearer for CUPP cannot be over-emphasised, as the question on everyone’s mind now is whether there is a formidable coalition what next”. He berated the incumbent administration of President Muhammadu Buhari for failing to fulfill its campaign promises to Nigerians, while lauding the coalition for its opposition against the ruling All Progressive Congress (APC). He said that if chosen as the presidential candidate by the coalition, he would transform the country and initiate people-centred policies. “Let me state categorically that it’s a great idea that the parties are coming together thereby providing the much needed structure and impetus to wrestle power from the hands of the failed APC-led presidency; but it’s another score entirely featuring the right candidate. “I fall under the category of the young, incorruptible, energetic and intelligent Nigerians capable of leading the country to the promised land; and I believe that, when elected, I will bring about the much needed change in this country which will culminate in security of life and properties of all citizens and dwellers, bountiful job opportunities, unity, massive infrastructural development, sanctity and an end to impunity”, he assured.
