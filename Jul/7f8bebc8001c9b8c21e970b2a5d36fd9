Ahead of Africa’s biggest vocational skills event, known as iCreate Skills Fest 2018, iCreate Africa recently organised a pre-event celebration to commemorate the World Youth Skills Day 2018. The event was held on July 15 in Abuja and attracted over 5,000 youths, including food vendors & fashion designers. The event was focused on celebrating and acknowledging young skilled professionals while giving them a platform to showcase their skills. This event was a preview of the main event which is set to happen in October, where more skills will be displayed through skills competition and exhibition across various fields, including brick laying, plumbing, carpentry, tilling, hair dressing, garment making, Robotics, web and graphic design and app development, among others. The iCreate Skill Fest is poised to catalyse the advancement of technical and vocational education and training (TVET) in Africa, by creating an environment that encourages and enables skill acquisition and skill excellence, according to the organisers. “A first of its kind initiative in Africa, the vision for iCreate Africa is to rebrand technical and vocational skills in a manner that is considerably more appealing and attractive to young people. We want to create success stories in the various skill sectors to inspire the future skilled workforce,” the organisers said, in a statement. The iCreate Skills Fest is open and free to the public and only youths aged 18 and 30 are eligible to enter the skills competition. The exhibition is open to small and medium enterprises (SMEs), multinationals, and indigenous companies who desire to showcase the quality and diversity of their products.
