Russian law enforcement cracked a case where illegal migrants travelling to third countries through Russia entered the country under the guise of football fans, Russian Deputy Interior Minister Igor Zubov said on Tuesday. When asked whether the issue can be considered resolved, he said it could. Zubov stressed though that the problem was not a wide-ranging one. “It was not an extensive problem,” he said.
