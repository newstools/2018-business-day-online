The DStv Eutelsat Star Awards is back following a successful Ugandan edition. This year, interested participants are expected to write a creative essay or design a poster on areas they believe the full potential of satellites, which are currently being used in a variety of ways, can be fully tapped or embraced for expansion and growth. Since its inception in 2011, the DStv Eutelsat Star Awards has created a meaningful engagement with students, the academic community and the scientific world and has also given young Africans the opportunity to see their dreams come true. Over 7,000 students have taken part in this pan-African collaboration, while 24 students from all over the continent have had their lives changed. In 2016, Emmanuel Ochenjele of Christian Discipleship Mission International Academy, Gboko, Benue State, emerged the continental winner in the poster category. Uganda-born Amos Mumbere, who was the overall winner in the previous edition, is set to fly to Paris in a couple of weeks, and onward to French Guiana to witness a live satellite launch as part of his prize. Similarly, Tajer Rasheed, winner of the poster category, has been in South Africa since July 15, as a guest of MultiChoice Africa where he visited the South African National Space Agency as part of his prize. He also saw the heritage sites such as Nelson Mandela’s former home in Soweto, the Constitution Hill and Soccer City. This time around, students between the ages of 14 and 19 stand a chance to walk in their footsteps by submitting their essay or poster to any MultiChoice office listed on the entry form. MultiChoice and Eutelsat are convinced of the power of science and technology education to encourage young minds to positively change their world. Their joint initiative, the DStv Eutelsat Star Awards, continues to inspire and excite young people across the continent to become involved and exposed to science and technology concepts, especially the satellite technology.
