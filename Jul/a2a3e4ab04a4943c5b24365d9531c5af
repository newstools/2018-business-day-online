Supreme Court Thursday delivered judgement upholding the appeal of the Senate President Bukola Saraki. The nationâ€™s apex court held that he has no case to answer before the CCT. The Senate President has been standing trial at the Code of Conduct Tribunal on 18 count charges. Recall that the Court had set July 6 as date for delivering judgment in an appeal filed by the Senate President, Bukola Saraki, challenging the ruling of the Court of Appeal which asked the Code of Conduct Tribunal (CCT) to try him on three of the 18 counts brought against him by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC).
