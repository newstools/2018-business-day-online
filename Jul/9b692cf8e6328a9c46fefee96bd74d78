Finance costs of some firms listed on the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) rose from N46.29 billion in June 2017 to N51.48 billion at half year 2018, translating to an average increase of 10.5 percent during the period.
The analysis of the finance costs of 15 non-bank firms quoted on the NSE by BusinessDay Research and Intelligence Unit (BRIU) at half year 2018 follows the retention of the monetary policy rate at 14 percent for the umpteenth time by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).
This decision of the CBN is against the wishes of the manufacturers in the country who want the monetary authorities to reduce the benchmark interest rate, following which it is expected to trickle down in the form of lower rates of interests on loans, particularly to players in the real sector of the economy.
A finance cost or borrowing cost refers to the interests and other costs which a firm incurs with regard to the borrowing of funds. Such costs may include account maintenance fees and costs of carrying the debt itself.
Caverton Offshore, Daar Communications, Lafarge Africa, Transcorp, Transnationwide Express and NAHCO recorded increase in finance costs in the first six months of 2018. Caverton Offshore expended N1.27 billion as finance cost at half year 2018 compared with N759.04 million it spent same period in 2017, amounting to 67 percent increase during the period.
Daar Communications’ finance costs rose by 51 percent from N39.65 million in June 2017 to N59.7 million in similar period in 2018. Lafarge Africa’s finance cost rose 106 percent from N11.5 billion in June 2017 to N23.7 billion at H1 2018.
Similarly, Transcorp had its finance cost rise by 7 percent from N4.7 billion in June 2017 to N5.01 billion same period this year. The finance costs of Transnationwide Express rose by 25 percent from N964,000 in June 2017 to N1.21 million while NAHCO expended N42.5 million on servicing loans in H1 2018 as against N19.7 million in 2017, representing an increase of 116 percent during the period.
On the contrary, CAP, Dangote Cement, Okomu Oil, UACN Property and Unilever recorded significant decline in their finance costs during period. CAP’s cost of debt servicing in the first six months of 2018 fell by 74 percent from N9.05 million in June last year to N2.40 million same period this year.
Dangote Cement witnessed 24 percent reduction in its finance costs as a result of which it spent N18.6 billion in the first six months of 2018 as against N24.4 billion same period last year. Okomu Oil reduced its finance costs by 31 percent just as UACN Property and Unilever recorded 27 percent and 89.6 percent in their finance costs at H1 2018 respectively. “Unilever did Rights Issue in 2017 through which it raised about N57 billion. That could have been responsible for the sharp fall in its finance costs”, Fola Abimbola, a research analyst with CSL Stockbrokers said. As the benchmark interest rate, the retention of MPR at 14 percent means that banks and other financial institutions cannot lend to businesses at lower rates than 14 percent. The CBN at the end of the Monetary Policy Meeting (MPC) meeting this week encouraged large corporations to consider the issuance of commercial papers with a possibility of the CBN buying those instruments back from them should the need arise.
