President Muhammadu Buhari has directed the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama and Minister of State, Aviation, Sen. Hadi Sirika, to commence the process of repatriating Nigerians who travelled to Russia for the FIFA 2018 World Cup and got stranded after the competition.
A statement signed by Garba Shehu, Senior Special Assistant to the President Media and Publicity, said already, the two ministries involved have taken measures to ensure prompt compliance with the directives.
The Nigerian football fans got stranded in the country following the activities of some unscrupulous travel agents who cancelled their return tickets and abandoned them to their fate.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister of Aviation have in compliance with the Presidentâ€™s directive taken the necessary actions to bring the Nigerians back.
The Statement said the Presidential directive is in line with the policy of the current administration to ensure the welfare of all Nigerians in every part of the world.
It would be recalled that the President Buhari administration has on several occasions ensured the repatriation of Nigerians from foreign countries like Libya and other conflict zones.
