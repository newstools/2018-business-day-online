The consensus view of the economists polled by BusinessDay is that inflation will trend higher in the second half of the year largely due to campaign spending. However, historical data dating from the late 90s shows that inflation typically declines in the years preceding an election.  Inflation in Nigeria is currently 11.61 percent and Central Bank of Nigeria is expecting inflation to hit single digit sometimes later this year. However, a number of economists including the IMF forecast inflation will remain at double digits till year end largely due to increased campaign spending as the contest for public office heats up before the general elections next year.  BusinessDay inflation analysis shows that in 1998 before the 1999 election, inflation declined from 10.2 percent in Jan 1998 to 7.9 percent by Dec 1998. In 2002, before the 2003 general elections, inflation also declined from 18.9 percent in Jan 2002 to 12.9 percent by the year end.  In 2006 inflation more than halved from 17.9 percent in Jan 2006 to 8.2 percent in Dec 2006. In 2010 the trend reversed for the first time as inflation rose from 12.6 percent at year beginning to 13.7 percent at year end. In 2014, the downward inflationary trend during the campaign year was once again observed as inflation fell 40 basis points from January to December.  Deeper analysis on campaign spending revealed that official campaign spending for the elections begins about 3 months before the election according to INEC rules.  When this new insight was investigated on the inflation chart, the results appear to be inconsistent in terms of inflation direction in months of increased campaign spending. While in 1998, 2007 and 2014, inflation trended downwards, there was a slight uptick in inflation in 1999 and 2015.  The years in which inflation had an uptick also coincided with years of dollar scarcity and sizable currency devaluation in the country which throws into question the impact campaign spending actually had on inflation. 1n 1999, dollar rose 321 percent against the Naira and in 2015 dollar rose 21 percent against the Naira. “There is no established relationship between inflation rate and pre-election spending in Nigeria,” Omotola Abimbola, a fixed income and currency specialist at EcoBank told BusinessDay.  “Inflation tends to be driven by major devaluation in exchange rate, investment repatriation of foreign investors due to political risk. However, Nigeria currently has stable exchange rate, surplus current account balances, and favourable oil price environment; therefore we may likely not see a major shock to inflation,” he added.  Electoral expenditure for the 1999 general elections by INEC was estimated at N1.5 billion. This increased to N29 billion in 2003 elections and further grew to N45.5 billion in 2007. By 2011 election, electoral expenditure was N111 billion while in 2015 elections, total electoral expenditure declined to N85 billion. Although total electoral expenditure seems to be exorbitant, it is very miniscule when compared to the total money supply in the country which CBN currently estimates to be around N24 trillion. Even if election spending reaches N600 billion, it will only account for less than 2 percent of money supply and less than 0.2 percent of GDP. Unless campaign spending directly puts pressure on items in the consumer price index basket of commodities, historical data suggests that its unlikely inflation will finish this year at a higher rate than year beginning as campaign spending enters Top gear in the second half of the year.
