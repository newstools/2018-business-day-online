Oshiomhole who stated that the business of governance must be driven by men and women of honour, adding that “ If the only motivation is personal interest, what is in it for me, what have gained, how many people have done xyz for, if that is the basis, the earlier those in this business of personal gains, the earlier they return to where they belong the better” “ I have said it here before that l will not lose sleep over the actions of those politicians without principles” Oshiomhole noted that their actions showed that they were actually not with the party from the onset. “ l cannot take you serious when you claim that you are answering my name only for you to take breakfast with me , eat lunch with the Python in the afternoons dinner with someone else in the evening” He described them as people without principles adding that the party’s electoral fortunes in 2019 will not be affected by the action of those who chose to decamp from its fold. “ You will discover that they have not electoral values. They are big masquerades in names but when you look deep, you will see that majority of these people won election into the National Assembly on the strength of the popularity of President Muhammadu Buhari” He also berated the lawmakers for adjourning abruptly and “ shutting down “ National Assembly “ adding that “ it shows that they are only after their own personal interest “ He lampooned they lawmakers for frustrating the administration of Buhari by refusing to confirm names of nominees from the President for various offices, adding that “ they cannot claim to be part of the APC while undermining the party” “To be very honest with you, it is better you formalize where you belong and be properly identified by your father’s name than purporting to bear my name and you are working for my opponent. Every observer particularly the elite core of the Nigerian media that is represented in the State House, you know that if there has been opposition to this APC government, that opposition has come within he ranks of members of the APC, some in the National Assembly.”
