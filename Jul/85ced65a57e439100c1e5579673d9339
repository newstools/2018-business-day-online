Until 2017, Ogun State had been Nigeria’s industrial hub. But BusinessDay analysis, published last Thursday, showed that the state was second choice in terms of industrial investments and expansion in 2017. Lagos overtook Ogun State, its closest rival, in terms of real sector investments, as manufacturers preferred to set up new plants and expand frontiers in Nigeria’s economic capital in 2017. Between 2014 and 2016, more than 70 percent of investments in agro processing, heavy and light manufacturing went to Ogun, while Lagos, which mainly made up of Ikeja and Apapa industrial zones, often attracted less than 20 percent of the total, according to data from the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN). However, the trend changed in 2017 as data show that the state posted only 28.59 percent of all the investments last year, whereas Lagos got 50.11 percent of total investments that year. The data show that out of N329.94 billion invested by manufacturers in the first half of 2017, 32.9 percent (N108.87 billion) went to Apapa zone. Ogun zone attracted 28.4 percent (N93.76 billion), while Ikeja got N67.27 billion (20.4 percent of total investment).  In the second half, manufacturers made investment estimated at N176.69 billion. While 28.9 percent or N51.11 billion worth of investment went to Ogun zone, 24 percent or N42.46 billion was channelled to Ikeja, while 20 percent or N35.33 billion went to Apapa zone. In the first and second half, Ogun got N144.87 billion out of the total N506.63 billion, representing 28.59 percent. However, Apapa got N144.2 billion (28.46 percent, while Ikeja got N109.73 billion (21.65 percent). This means that Ikeja and Apapa got N253.93 billion, representing 50.11 percent. But before 2017, Ogun alone often dwarfed both Apapa and Ikeja put together. Manufacturers in Ogun, interviewed by this newspaper, wanted the state government to make processes clearer for investors. They said government should pay more attention to keeping already existing investors through incentives rather than just focusing on getting new ones. “It should not just be about revenue drive but about reducing various taxes and levies paid by investors,” a chief executive of a manufacturing firm in Otta axis, told BusinessDay. Manufacturers in Agbara-Igbesa, a major industrial cluster, want roads in that axis rehabilitated. Obi Ezeude,CEO of Beloxxi’s Industries, complained on February 8 this year, during  a factory commissioning, that poor state of roads in Agbara was hurting manufacturers as vehicles often got stuck. Speaking at the 9th quarterly interactive Session with Ogun State government in Abeokuta in March 2017, Wale Adegbite, chairman, Manufacturers Association of Nigeria, Ogun State Chapter, had noted that apart from poor state of roads which were causing economic and man-hour losses, multiple taxation were also rife in the state. He had urged the state government to tackle them head-on in order to increase production capacity of manufacturers. Manufacturers in the state also said that things were becoming more predictable in Lagos and less so in Ogun as many government agencies are now asking for the similar fees and levies in Ogun. They say Ogun, which, in the past, benefitted from proximity to Lagos and poor doing business in Nigeria’s economic capital, must begin to do more in order not to lose existing investors and discourage incoming ones.
