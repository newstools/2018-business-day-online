The Forum of Legislative Aides to the Senate president, Bukola Saraki, has hailed the Supreme Court judgment that discharged and acquitted him of allegations of false assets declaration. The forum said the landmark judgment was a vindication of Saraki’s persistent claim that the assets declaration charges were trumped up charges and politically motivated. In a statement signed by the Kwara Central coordinator of the Senate President’s Legislative Aides Forum, AbdulRasaq Oba Bolanta, the forum said it had always been its belief that Saraki would be vindicated at the end of the day, knowing fully well that the former Kwara State governor is an upright and incorruptible politician. It, therefore, thanked the Nigerian judiciary for standing by the truth in discharging and acquitting the Senate President, not minding the interest of the powerful cabal that orchestrated the Code of Conduct Tribunal’s trial. “It gladdens our heart that the judicial officers right from CCT to the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court did a thorough job, stand by the truth and refused to be rail roaded into perverting the course of justice. The judiciary has indeed proved that its the last hope of not only the common man but the oppressed, ” it stated. It added that the apex court’s judgement affirmed what Kwarans have always contended that the Saraki was completely innocent of all the charges that the presidency has been slamming on him since 2015. The forum thanked the Emir of Ilorin, Ibrahim Sulu- Gambari, Governor Abdulfatah Ahmed, Speaker, Kwara State House of Assembly, Ali Ahmad, the All Progressives Congress ( APC) leadership in the state led by Ishola Balogun- Fulani, party’s chieftains and supporters and well meaning individuals and groups across the country for standing with Saraki while the trial lasted. It assured the Senate President of the continued loyalty and support of the legislative aides and prayed God to further elevate him to a higher political office.
