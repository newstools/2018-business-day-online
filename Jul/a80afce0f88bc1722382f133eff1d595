With a total of 25 stores, Shoprite Nigeria offers consumers a world-class shopping experience through its core business promise of everyday low prices. The supermarket chain’s extensive range includes restaurant quality products such as extra-matured Steakhouse Classic steaks, wine sourced from the top-wine producing countries around the world, freshly baked breads and so much more.

It’s up to us to let the rest of the world know this.”
