Senator Soji Akanbi, one of the senators listed to have defected from the All Progressives Congress (APC), to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), has said that he was still with the APC. Senate President Bukola Saraki had announced at plenary on Tuesday that 15 senators had defected from the APC to the PDP. Among those listed was Akanbi, who represents Oyo South. But Akanbi, who briefed newsmen after the plenary, said that he was still with the APC. “Today, my name was wrongly mentioned in the list of the people that defected to PDP. “When I heard my name, I raised a point of order and was able to clear my name. I have never been part of defection from APC to PDP. “I remain a member of APC. I am a committed and unrepentant member of the party,” Akanbi stated. On why the error occurred, he said that it might have been caused by a rumour that he had an ambition “either declared or undeclared”. “Because you have a crisis in your state with your governor, people assume that you will automatically leave your party “In Oyo, we don’t have crisis with my governor, Abiola Ajimobi. “Ajimobi is the leader of the party in the state and I remain his associate and very close ally. “In my state, we strongly believe that if there is any crisis in the party, we must find a way to solve it,” he said.
