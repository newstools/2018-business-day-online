House of Representatives on Thursday, urged Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC) to relocate its western operational headquarters to Warri, Delta state without further delay. The resolution was passed following the adoption of a motion sponsored by Lovette Idisi (PDP-Delta) who argued that peace has returned to Warri and the entire Niger Delta region. In his lead debate, Idisi said that Warri is affected by the unpleasant decision by Shell to temporarily relocate its western headquarters from Warri in 2013 on the excuse of a hostile business environment. The lawmaker however observed that the hostile environment Shell management cited for its relocation had indeed been engendered by the neglect and impoverishment of the people through the adverse effects of oil exploration activities of oil companies. He admitted that the oil companies require sustainable peace and business friendly environment to perform optimally. In his remarks, Daniel Reyenieju (PDP-Delta) urged the National Assembly to use its legislative power to compel Shell Nigeria Development Corporation of Nigeria (SNEPCO) to relocate its western operational headquarters and offices back to Warri. The lawmaker explained that the fundamental causal factor resulting from the aforementioned crises that engulfed Warri and environs which necessitated SPDC to relocate its western operational headquarters and offices from Warri has long been peacefully resolved with the hitherto warring groups leaving peacefully among themselves. He observed further that all the residential and office building complexes and facilities earlier used by SPDC in Warri (prior to its departure) are still intact, adding that it will cost the international oil company almost nothing to effect the desired relocation back to Warri.
