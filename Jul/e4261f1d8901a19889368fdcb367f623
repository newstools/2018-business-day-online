The mass defection from the ruling All Progressive Congress, APC continued Wednesday as the governor of Benue state Samuel Ortom announced he had left the party to join the opposition PDP. He spoke to journalists and council chairmen and councillors at the state house in Markudi, the state capital with chants of justice and equity filled the air, a reflection of the anger and disappointment off those who had gathered. Hundreds of youths had earlier gathered at the state house to prevent the governor from taking a flight to Abuja to attend a reconciliation meeting called by the leadership of the APC and it soon became clear the governor would leave the ruling party. Ortom said he had been given a blank cheque by all the council chairmen in the state to defect from the APC to continue the struggle for justice for the people of Benue state and as he spoke, the local government leaders cheered him on. Shortly before Ortomâ€™s defection senate President Bukola Saraki told journalists that his own defection would happen sooner than many expect. Ortom whose defection had long been expected seem to have reached the end of the road in the APC after he said the party had handed him the red card and after most APC federal legislators from Benue state defected on Tuesday. The political centre in Benue and some say Plateau and parts of the Middle belt has been tilting towards the right following an endless bloody campaign mounted against the people of the area by cattle shepherds with the people alleging that the ruling party has been unwilling to bring the killing to an end. The ruling party has so far claimed that the defections would have no meaningful impact on its election fortunes next year but political analysts dismiss the claim as mere arrogance and point to a gradual shrinking of the support base of the APC in some very critical regions in the country. On Tuesday more than a dozen senators and over 30 members of the lower House of Representatives defected from the ruling party to the opposition PDP culminating in a drama at both the senate and the house.
