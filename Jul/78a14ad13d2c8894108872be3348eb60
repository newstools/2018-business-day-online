Kehinde Oloruntoba, Kogi State Commissioner for Agriculture has said that the country will be food sufficient by 2020 owing to the Federal Government renewed commitment to agriculture and its food security target. Oloruntoba stated this over the weekend during a one day summit organised by International Youth Empowerment Summit (IYES) at Federal University Lokoja with the theme ‘Identifying and Maximising Entrepreneurial Opportunity in a Recovery Economy’. The commissioner explained that Yahaya Bello, Governor of Kogi State, has made it clear that he will diversify the economy of the state through agriculture, stressing the need for mechanised farming in the country. He equally stated that Kogi state government has purchased tractors that have been distributed to the three senatorial districts to drive mechanised farming in the state. Oloruntoba lamented that for so many years agriculture was abandoned and farmers continued to farm with old techniques resulting in low productivity and gaps in food production. He commended President Mohammadu Buhari for his giant stride in giving agriculture a great lift since his assumption of office, while stressing on the need for the government to maintain such momentum. He urged the participants at the IYES to make agriculture their ponzi scheme, adding that Nigerians for a long time abandoned agriculture which is the real profitable business and were chasing shadows. The commissioner disclosed to the participants that the ministry of agriculture is doing a lot of empowerment programme for youths in the state, adding that the ministry is looking at collaborating with IYES management. He also advised students to seek further trainings upon graduation, adding that the ministry now sells seedlings to farmers, saying all this are geared towards bridging the seed gap in the state.
