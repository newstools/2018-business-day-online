Atiku Abubakar, a former vice president and presidential aspirant on the platform of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) has sent his condolences to the families of all military servicemen who were recently laid to rest after paying the supreme price. This was contained in a statement issued by his media office in Abuja. Atiku also prayed for the grieving families. “I saw the photos of the burial of our gallant soldiers killed by Boko Haram and I was moved. Your husbands, fathers, sons and brothers did not die in vain. Rather, they gave their lives for the unity of this great nation. They paid the highest sacrifice for the highest ideal, that Nigeria may triumph and be a better place to live in,” he said. According to him, “There is no greater patriotism than to give your life for your nation, and in my opinion, there is no greater way to honour such patriotism, such heroism, than to have the leadership of the nation one died defending attend such an honourable homecoming. Such honourable men and women deserve the best from our nation. “I would like to suggest that at no time should such heroes be buried without having the presence of either the President or his high level representative in attendance. There is no better way to honour those who died that Nigeria may live. Adieu to those gallant men and women. You have not fallen in battle. You have fallen into the pages of the history book of Nigeria’s heroes.”
