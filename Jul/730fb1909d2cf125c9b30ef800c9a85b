After several months of consultations with critical stakeholders in Nigeria and members of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar will on Saturday, 21 July, make a formal declaration to contest the 2019 presidential election under the PDP. A press release from the media office of the former Vice President noted that Atiku will be making his declaration at a political rally in Yola, the capital of his home state of Adamawa. According to the press release, Atiku’s decision to join the presidential race in 2019 is in response to the yearnings of majority of Nigerians to enthrone a government that will fix the country’s broken economy, strengthen national unity and create much-needed jobs for Nigerians. “After extensive consultations with his family, Nigerians of diverse dispensations at home and abroad, His Excellency Atiku Abubakar has decided to make a formal bid for the 2019 presidential election race under the ticket of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP)”, the statement said. Atiku Abubakar has embarked on nationwide consultative visits to many states across the country where he met with stakeholders in the PDP.

The statement added that Atiku’s declaration on Saturday will be followed with the unveiling of a policy document that will give a clear direction to the solutions that the former Vice President hopes to bring to bear in governance if elected president of the country. “The campaign’s policy documents being baked by policy experts from diverse backgrounds and youth professionals across the country will be unveiled as soon as the process is concluded. “The policy document covers a large area of Nigeria’s national life including the economy, restructuring, education, healthcare, agriculture, youth and women development among many others”, the statement added.
