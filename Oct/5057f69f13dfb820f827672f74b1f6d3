Nigeria’s House of Representatives during Wednesday plenary session unveiled plans to investigate the presence of a Chinese drug made with human flesh and organs in Nigeria. The resolution was passed following the adoption of a motion under Matters of Urgent National Importance, sponsored by Johnson Agbonayinma (APC-Edo). To this end, the House mandated the joint committees on Healthcare Services, Women Affairs and Social Development, and Information, National Orientation, Ethics and Values, NAFDAC and National Intelligence Agency (NIA) to probe the allegation. The joint Committees are expected to invite the management of Nigerian Customs, National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) and Nigeria Intelligence Agency in the bid to ascertain whether the said drug is available in the country or otherwise. They are also to identify the importers of the said drug and prosecute them and their collaborators and report back to the House within four weeks for further legislative action. In his lead debate, Agbonayinma (APC-Edo) observed that NIA recently placed the Nigerian Customs Service, NAFDAC and the Standards Organisation of Nigeria (SON) on red alert over a Chinese drug made with human flesh and organs smuggled into Nigeria. “The House is aware that the SON confirmed receipt of the letter sent in Chinese drugs reported to be made into capsules made from powdered flesh from dead babies. “The House is concerned that making of human remains drugs and consuming them are crimes against humanity, which can also lead to serious health challenges. “The House is disturbed that if immediate measures are not taken to stem the influx of these drugs and the illegal importers, it will continue to endanger the lives of citizens,” the lawmaker said. When the Speaker, Yakubu Dogara called for a vote on the motion, it was passes by a majority of members and referred to the relevant committees.  KEHINDE AKINTOLA, Abuja
