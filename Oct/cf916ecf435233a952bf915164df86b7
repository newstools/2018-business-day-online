Fapohunda and Kolawole are expected to be handed the portfolios of Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice as well as Commissioner for Finance and Economic Development, respectively. They earlier served in that capacities during the first administration of Governor Fayemi between 2010 and 2014. The Assembly at its plenary on Thursday also endorsed Fayemi’s approval for the appointment of ten Special Advisers. The Speaker, Adeniran Alagbada, who read a letter from the governor to his colleagues at plenary,  urged them to adequately look into the request for smooth runnings of government. The two commissioner nominees were differently grilled by members of the House and were deemed qualified for membership of the State Executive Council. The lawmakers unanimously observed that both men had served the state in the past and performed creditably well. The duo are expected to be sworn by the governor in any moment from now. The Deputy Speaker, Segun Adewumi, charged the two commissioner nominees to think outside the box by attracting businesses into the state to improve the economy instead of overtaxing the people. Alagbada commended Fayemi for choosing people of integrity as commissioners and praised his colleagues for their prompt action. RAPHAEL ADEYANJU, Ado-Ekiti
