Also, the council rejected the letter of voluntary retirement written by Justice Joshua E. Ikede of the High Court of Delta State. This is due to the fact that the allegation of falsification of age against the judge was found to be true, as he ought to have retired since 2016. His retirement was backdated to 2016 and the Delta State government was asked to deduct two yearsâ€™ salary from his benefits.
