The new regulations introduced last season, were part of the reason that Red Bull had to increase its spending on its two F1 teams by 17.5% in 2017, The energy drinks manufacturer upping its spending to a record $223.8m Forbes reveals that according to Red Bull Racing’s latest financial statements, it spent $301.9m in 2017, up 16.8% on 2016.
The documents state that “the cost base remains under tight control, with the increased costs in the year reflecting a combination of higher chassis development, increased driver costs and payments for the power unit”.

Whether the racing improved is debatable, but Mercedes still won both titles and Red Bull slipped behind the German team and Ferrari in the constructor standings.
Red Bull Racing is owned by Red Bull Technology, which although involved in other projects including a 225 mph hypercar with Aston Martin and a partnership Sunseeker to develop a range of yachts, its “principal activity (of the group) is the design, development and manufacture of Formula One racing cars”.
