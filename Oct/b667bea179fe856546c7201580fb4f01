There are indicators that Adams Oshiomhole will lost his job as the National Chairman of the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC. This is as APC Governors and some key stakeholders of the party Thursday met in Abuja to pass vote of confidence on Oshiomhole. APC Governors particularly made the move early in the  Week but could not succeed as the number available did not form the quorum of the 23 members. But in the current attempt, the second term governors have secured the support of their first term colleagues and other stakeholders including some National Assembly Members who were hitherto not keen about ousting Oshiomhole. Most APC Governors are angry with Oshiomhole for frustrating their candidates bid to secure the party tickets at the just concluded primaries. A ranking member of the party privy to the meeting who pleaded for anonymity said, “the Governors are bent on removing Oshiomhole for rendering them almost politically relevant”. Oshiomhole is presently in the United States and is being expected back at the Weekend. At the time this report the outcome of the meeting held at one of the Governors Lodges was not known.
