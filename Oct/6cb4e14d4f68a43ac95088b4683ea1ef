Gerald Chukwuma studied painting at Nsukka Art School, University of Nigeria, and began his career as a painter before developing a multitude of techniques including burning, chiselling, and collage, he uses  these techniques to create  wood-slate found material sculptures that he is becoming increasingly noted for.  These intricately crafted and painted relief works are embedded with rich layers of history and personal and political meaning, deriving from his ongoing exploration of the process of transformation and reinvention that occurs through migration, and his reflections on Nigeria’s socio-political landscape and the local implications of the seemingly inexorable process of globalization. Chukwuma’s works have seen him exhibit beyond Nigeria, including exhibitions in Cameroon, Denmark, the Netherlands and the United States. He recently held a solo show, Standing Ovation, at Gallery 1957 in Accra, Ghana in 2017. Gerald Chukwuma will be showcasing his works at the Gallery 1957 booth at ART X Lagos 2018. ART X Lagos the 2018 edition will hold from 2nd to 4th November at the Civic Centre, Victoria Island, Lagos. Visit  https://artxlagos.com/tickets/ to purchase tickets.
