  The Presidential Candidate of the African Democratic Congress (ADC), Obadiah Mailafia, has vowed to crush insurgency in the North East within three months if elected as President in 2019. The former deputy governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), who fingered foreign conspirators in the fight against insurgency, pointed out that Nigeria has the capacity to garner sufficient intelligence to defeat the insurgents. Mailafia promised to shut the boarders of the country in order to check the influx of illegal persons. Addressing a press conference in Abuja at the weekend, he lamented the seeming abuse of the ECOWAS protocol, adding that people who come into the country from neighbouring countries are expected to do so legitimately.  The ADC presidential candidate, who decried the rate of abuse of immunity in the country particularly with regards to corruption matters, lamented what he called the cosmetic approach to the anti-graft war. “We will close the borders and renegotiate with neighbouring countries on the influx of people into the country. Movement of people must be controlled,” he said.  He added that they expected to stay for a period of three months. “Give me three months; I will crush insurgency in the North East. Don’t see me talking like a soft voice. Inside me is a lion. I studied Military Science. Give me three months I will crush insurgency; we have the technology to crush insurgency,” he further said.  He fingered international conspiracy against Nigeria in the fight against insurgents, alleging that they train insurgents and give them intelligence on how to attack the Nigeria military. He alleged that the foreign powers don’t want Nigeria to rise, stressing that “they know that if Nigeria makes it that will put an end to the sufferings of the Black Race.”  OWEDE AGBAJILEKE, Abuja
