 The President had paid tribute to former Chief Justice of Nigeria, late Justice Muhammed Idris Legbo Kutigi, hailing his contributions to the evolution of the country’s jurisprudence. A statement by the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, said President, while also honouring the late CJN by authorizing his burial at the National Cemetery, Abuja, said the nation will not forget the hard work and dedication of the eminent jurist. The National Cemetery is reserved for the nation’s fallen heroes and it requires discretionary approval of a sitting President for a citizen to be given a final resting place in its grounds. President Buhari had sent a government delegation led by his Chief of Staff, Abba Kyari to represent him at the funeral prayer at the National Mosque, Abuja and thereafter, the burial at the National Cemetery. Other members of the Presidential delegation were the Attorney-General and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, SAN, the Minister of the Federal Capital Territory, Muhammed Bello and the Minister of Education, Adamu Adamu. The government delegation had also paid a condolence visit to the widows and other family members of Justice Kutigi at his residence in Asokoro, Abuja.
