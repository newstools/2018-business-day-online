The joining of PRP does not seem to hold much prospect for Senator Sani in a state that is seemingly firmly under the thumb of El-Rufai’s APC. Although the former chairman of the party, Balarabe Musa, is loved and highly respected in the state, that has not amounted to electoral victory for the PRP. It is doubtful, therefore, if Sani’s entrance into the party would change its fortune.  In 1979 the party was able to capture two out of 12 states and came third in the national elections. It has however, not made any appreciable impact since 1999. In December 2012, it was deregistered alongside 28 other political parties. But, it got its status back through a court ruling, which moved the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to re-register it. It, however, did not participate in the 2015 general election.
