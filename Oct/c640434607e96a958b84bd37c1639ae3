The Senate has confirmed the appointment of seven nominees as members of the Code of Conduct Bureau (CCB). It, however, rejected one of the nominees on account of being underaged. Presenting his report at Wednesday plenary, Chairman Senate Committee on Ethics, Privileges and Public Petitions, Samuel Anyanwu, noted that two other nominees, Ganiyu Hamzat and Vincent Nwanli failed to show up. According to him, the committee did not confirm the appointment of another nominee, Danjuma Sado, because he was below the approved age of 50 years to serve in the commission, as required in the law setting up the body. The upper legislative chamber confirmed Muhammed Isah as Chairman of CCB. Other members of the Bureau whose appointments were confirmed include Murtala Kankia (Jigawa, North West), Emmanuel Attah (Katsina, North West), Ubolo Okpanachi (Kogi, North Central), Ken Alkali (Nasarawa, North Central), S F. Ogundare (Oyo, South West) and Saad Abubakar (Gombe, North East). Speaking after the confirmation, Senate President Bukola Saraki advised the President to forward the other three nominees for screening.  OWEDE AGBAJILEKE, Abuja
