The renowned Lagos artist Alimi Adewale, whose work explores various aspects of urbanisation, and the condition of everyday man will exhibit at ART X Lagos 2018, at the ArtHouse – The Space booth. In richly textured “sculptural” portraits and landscapes, often rendered in oil on canvas or in mixed media involving photography and acrylic paint, Alimi combines elements of minimalism and abstraction to evoke the movement, tensions and intensity inherent in the cosmopolitan environment. His nudes, meanwhile, probe the unacceptability of the idea of the nude figure in art, especially in African art, while his sculptures examine the experiential function of art in relation to the traditional function of African sculpture. His recent solo exhibitions include Restrictions, Galleri Astley, Uttersberg, Sweden (2016); Divergence, Alara, Lagos, Nigeria (2015); and Megalopolis, Just Africa, Stockholm, Sweden (2015). He was the Artist in Residence at Konstepidemin, Sweden, in September/October 2016 and at Miliki, Lagos, in March/April 2017. ART X Lagos the 2018 edition will hold from 2nd to 4th November at the Civic Centre, Victoria Island, Lagos. Visit https://artxlagos.com/tickets/ to purchase tickets.
