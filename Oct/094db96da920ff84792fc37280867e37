President Muhammadu Buhari has distanced himself from a letter currently in circulation, purportedly written by Governor Nasir El- Rufai of Kaduna state, which alleges that the President had authorized the Governor to sanction Shehu Sani, Senator, representing Kaduna Central Senatorial district for disloyalty. A statement by the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, said the President had neither received such letter, nor instructed anyone else for that matter to “deal with traitors and disloyal members of APC, especially Senator Shehu Sani.” “We wish to confirm that the President is not aware of any such letter, let alone authorising anyone to deal with any party member” The statement noted that given President Buhari’s record, it is inconceivable that he would usurp the role of the party leaders and instruct anyone to punish a party member. “In the light of above, we would like to appeal to the general public, especially members of the press, to ignore false or unauthorized information intended to attribute to the President any action which is not in line with his character.” In the letter purportedly addressed to Buhari by el-Rufai, the Governor is said to have listed Sani’s sins to criticizing the federal government due to the killings in the country.
In the said letter, the Kaduna governor was alleged to have revealed that Buhari directed him to begin impeachment proceedings for Sani over acts of contempt and disloyalty.
“When your excellency traveled to London in April 2018 for medical consultation, Shehu Sani ridiculed it on Facebook as ‘Voyage to London, Season 3,” The Cable quoted el-Rufai as saying in the letter dated October 3. “In May 2018, he lamented what he said was Buhari’ s three years of failure to protect human lives.
