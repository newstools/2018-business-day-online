The Chairman, Senate Committee on Local and Foreign Debts, Shehu Sani, on Wednesday announced his membership of the Peoples Redemption Party (PRP). He spoke on the floor of the Senate while contributing to a motion on the recent violence in Kaduna State. Sani’s announcement came barely 72 hours after he announced his resignation from the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), after the party refused to give him automatic ticket and instead gave the Kaduna Central Senatorial ticket to Uba Sani, an aide to Kaduna State Governor, Nasir el-Rufai. However, BusinessDay observed that the embattled lawmaker is still sitting on the row of APC as he is yet to formally announce his defection on the hallowed chamber. This will involve writing officially to the Senate President on the matter. According to parliamentary convention, while APC senators are seated on the same row, opposition lawmakers are seated in another row. Opposition party lawmakers sitting on the same area are those of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), All Progressive Grand Alliance (APGA) and African Democratic Congress (ADC). Order 11 (1) of the Senate Standing Order 2015 (as amended) also prescribes that “The President of the Senate shall allocate a seat to each senator”. It would be recalled that a rowdy session had ensued last week after Senate President Bukola Saraki refused to recognise the immediate past Senate Minority Leader, Godswill Akpabio, on the floor of the hallowed chamber for not sitting in the seat allocated to him.
