He explained, “Uptill now, none of the results have been released to the public. There is palpable fears everywhere. In the case of the election under reference not only were the results not declared at the appropriate constituency levels, the results were not made available to the agents of aspirants, the DSS, INEC and the police. “The results were only referred to Ilorin for “approval and anouncement” this heighten fear that the policy is prone to manipulation and that really is our fear. “We are specifically told that Isaac Gbenga Adeyemi from all harvested votes is the winner of Isin/ Ekiti/ Oke-Ero/ Irepodun Federal Constituency. There is rumor attempt to give it to a rival and while Lola Ashiru is the winner of South senatorial district primary election, there is the attempt to give it to another rival who lost out. “The governorship is massively won by Suaib Oba Abdulraheem, but some people are saying that Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq is the anointed candidate. “In other not to impugn on the credibility of this election, the results ought to be released forthwith and that is our call” As at the time of filling this report, (6:50 pm), the governorship primary election of the state is yet to be announced.
