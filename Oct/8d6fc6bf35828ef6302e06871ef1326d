The organisers of Tokyo 2020 has announced the first part of its planned test event schedule ahead of the next Olympic and Paralympic Games. A total of 50 test events will be held as they hone preparations for the Games.
Several of the events will be scheduled international competitions which were already due to take place in Japan, while others will have been organised as dedicated Tokyo 2020 test events. “Test plans for each sport have been drawn up and reviewed in close collaboration with the respective International Federations based on a needs assessment conducted for each sport,” Tokyo 2020 said. “The test event schedule has also benefited from Olympic Agenda 2020’s the New Norm, which allowed an optimised programme to be created following the creation of new principles for test events management. “The test events themselves will be operated using actual equipment, facilities and venues that will be deployed at the Tokyo 2020 Games. “In addition, each functional area of Tokyo 2020 will test the technical operation of events focusing on three aspects: the field of play, technology and staff. “The experience gained will be shared as part of the organisation-wide learning pathway.” Tokyo 2020 said the event was fully supported by World Sailing, who had previously been critical of their sport’s preparations for the Games, in collaboration with the local Organising Committee. A second, specific, sailing test event is currently scheduled to take place in August next year. The Olympic Games is scheduled to hold in Tokyo, Japan from August 25th to September 6th, 2020.
