Following trending social media messages that the Islamic Movement of Nigeria (IMN) popularly known as Shiite are planning a major procession into the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) to demand the release of their detained leader Ibrahim El-Zakzaky, the FCT Police Command has assured the Nigerian public that it has deployed both uniform and plain-clothe police operatives at strategic points to forestall any breakdown of law and order in the Federal Capital Territory. A statement issued on Sunday by the Police Public Relation’s Officer FCT Police Command, Anjuguri Manzah, a Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP), noted that adequate security measures have also been put in place to protect lives and property and to ensure free flow of vehicular movement in and out of FCT. Part of the statement read; “Members of the public are therefore enjoined to feel free to go about their lawful activities. The Command seizes this medium to address members of the Islamic Movement of Nigeria on the need to be law abiding, and ensure they write and secure the appropriate clearance before embarking on any form of procession in FCT.” Clashes between the police and the Shiite members had reportedly led to the death of three persons at the weekend even as the sect threatened more protests this week.
