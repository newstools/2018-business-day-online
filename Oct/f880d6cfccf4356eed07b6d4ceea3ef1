The Nigerian Airspace Management Agency, (NAMA) has restored it’s  services to Osubi airstrip, consequent upon the payment of N31 million by Shoreline Oil Services Ltd, operators of the airstrip. The N31 million is said to be  part payment of accumulated charges for the provision of air traffic services at the airstrip by NAMA. The payment leaves Shoreline Oil Services with a debt balance of N566, 422, 000.50 as at the 28th October, 2018. It will be recalled that NAMA took the decision to withdraw air traffic services to Osubi airstrip after Shoreline Oil Services persistently refused to pay financial obligation to NAMA despite several entreaties. However BusinessDay has earlier reported that the operator had refused to pay because they saw the costs as exorbitant and not justifiable when compared to the services NAMA provided. In a statement issued by NAMA yesterday and signed by Khalid Emele, spokesperson for the agency, it stated “As a responsible corporate citizen and provider of critical services to the nation’s civil aviation sector, we felt obliged to restore our services to the airstrip with the understanding that Shoreline Oil Services will take full advantage of this window of opportunity to make additional payment that will substantially defray the above N566, 422, 000.50 debt as well as agree on a concrete and workable payment plan that will clear the outstanding balance. “It is our hope that going forward, and in the spirit of the renewed understanding between both organizations, Shoreline will reciprocate this gesture by paying for our services as and when due.” The agency also assured all its service users, stakeholders and the general public that it remains committed to its goal of providing seamless air traffic services in a safe, economic and efficient manner.
