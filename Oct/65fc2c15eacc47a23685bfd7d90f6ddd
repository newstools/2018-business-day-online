Presidency has announced that the weekly Federal Executive Council FEC, will not hold this week. This is just as political activities have relegated governance to the background as politicians battle to either retain their positions or take over from the current occupants of those seats. A statement by the Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, on Tuesday announced that “ Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting will not take place on Wednesday, October 3, 2018” According to him, “ This is informed by on-going political activities, particularly party primaries, in which some members of the Council are deeply involved in various states of the federation. This is also the fate of most government institutions, including Ministries, Departments and Agencies MDAs, of government in the nation’s political capital, Abuja. Political appointees and their aides have also travelled outside Abuja to join their principals in the battle to either retain their positions, or take over new ones. BusinessDay investigations show that the development has led to many official matters being kept in abeyance until the political activists are done with. BusinessDay gathered that some of President Buhari’s Ministers who are contesting for various offices have abandoned their offices. The Minister of Defence, Mansur Dan Ali and his Niger Delta counterpart, Usani Uguru Usani who have been cleared to contest the governorship elections in Zamfara and Cross Rivers states respectively are said to now spend more time pursuing their political projects. This is the same for some agencies where their heads are also vying for the Governorship tickets. BusinessDay recall that the President had earlier directed his Ministers to return to the grassroots to strengthen the party’s position, ahead of the 2019 general elections.
