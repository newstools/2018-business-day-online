Delta Association of Chambers of Commerce, Industry, Mines and Agriculture (DACCIMA) is making good her plan to revive the moribund trade fair programme, as it is now out for the 2018 edition of the fair billed for November 15 – 25.
DACCIMA is organising the 11th annual trade fair in collaboration with the Delta State government through the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. DACCIMA believes that trade fair 2018 is the veritable opportunity for manufacturers and distributors to showcase their products to the discerning consumers in the state, even as it said the fair promised to be a 10-day of brisk business and B2B for investors wishing to do business in the state. A statement signed by the chairman, publicity subcommittee and the chairman, 2018 Trade Fair, Iwemdi Nwaham and Okiemute Dukuye, stated that the fair would hold at the Delta State Trade Fair Ground, Osubi, near Warri. According to the statement, the theme of this year’s fair is, “Boosting Nigeria’s Economy Through Entrepreneurial Initiative”, saying that it is a golden opportunity for Delta State to showcase the wonderful works of the current government of the state under Governor Ifeanyi Okowa. The statement further urged Deltans to partner with DACCIMA to parade the numerous testimonies of the state and the various achievements of the job creation programmes of the state government. Earlier in the year, while honouring some prominent business men in the state for their role in sustaining the economy of the state, the state chairman of DACCIMA, Emma Avworo had assured that DACCIMA would revive its trade fair program that had been moribund. According to him, it would not be a fair for herbalists but of serious manufacturers to showcase their product.
