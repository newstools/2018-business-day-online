The National Working Committee(NWC) of the All Progressives Congress, APC has postponed the Senate Primaries in the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory earlier scheduled Tuesday to Wednesday. No reason was given for the postponement but this can not be unconnected with the late submission of the Senate Screening Committee and the earlier shifting of governorship primaries in some States from Sunday
to Monday. The Senate Screening Committee Business Day learnt submitted its report late Sunday night to the NWC which made certain decisions and accordingly published list of cleared aspirants Monday evening. According to the report, 281aspirants have been cleared to contest the APC Senatorial tickets in their various constituencies across the country. Meanwhile, APC has disqualified former Inspector General of Police, Suleiman Abba from contesting the Party’s Jigawa South Senatorial District Primaries. No reason have been given for his disqualification as the Acting National Publicity of APC simply stated that,  “Abba’s name was erroneously included in the list of NWC-cleared aspirants”. APC on the other hand has cleared Hope Uzodinma to contest for both Imo  Governorship and Imo West Senatorial tickets. Uzodinma name appeared first on the list of the nine aspirants cleared last week to contest for APC governorship ticket in Imo state while it appeared Monday as the only aspirant wrestling for the  Imo West ticket with Governor Rochas Okorocha, also cleared. Also, APC NWC Monday suspended the crisis riddden Imo  State governorship primary election indefinitely. No reason was adduced but this could be because of the violence that marred the exercise with lives and property destroyed.
