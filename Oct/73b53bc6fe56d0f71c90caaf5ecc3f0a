Real Madrid manager Julen Lopetegui may loss his job after his side suffered a woeful a 5-1 defeat to Barcelona at Camp Nou on Sunday and former Juventus and Chelsea manger Antonio Conte is tipped to take over. Real Madrid President Florentino Perez is set to discuss the coaching situation with his directors in the coming hours and it is looking increasingly likely that Julen Lopetegui will be replaced by former Chelsea manager Antonio Conte next week. Five goals conceded at the Camp Nou appear to have sealed Lopetegui’s fate and the Italian could arrive as early as Monday. If not, Santiago Solari will take temporary charge of the first team for Wednesday’s Copa del Rey game against Melilla. Conte is likely to be Real Madrid’s next coach, after finally resolving his contract dispute with former club Chelsea, freeing him up to take over at another club without taking a financial loss. The president and his board of directors see Lopetegui’s position as unsustainable and are looking to take action immediately. Florentino left the Camp Nou immediately after the game without speaking to the players or his coach. Confidence has been completely lost in the Basque and although his players have all defended him, they are not performing. The consensus at the club is that a coach with a big personality is needed to drill the players into getting back to their best and Conte is seen as exactly that.  Anthony Nlebem
