President Muhammadu Buhari on Wednesday, assured Rebecca Sharibu, Mother of Dapchi Secondary schoolgirl, Leah, who had been under the captivity of Boko Haram that his administration will do everything to bring back her daughter. A statement by the Senior Special Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, said the President stated this on Wednesday, when he called and spoke with Rebecca Sharibu on the issue. The President who also consoled the Sharibu family, assured the parents that the Federal Government would do its utmost for the safety and security of their daughter. “I convey my emotion, the strong commitment of my administration and the solidarity of all Nigerians to you and your family as we will do our best to bring your daughter home in peace and safety,” President Buhari told her. He assured the mother that his heart was with her family, as that of the entire nation which continues to pray for the safe return of “our daughter, Leah.” The President’s statement is coming on the heels of several appeals to the federal government to do every thing to secure Leah’s release, following threats by Boko Haram to kill her. Leah’s parents had following the expiration of the October deadline given by Boko Haram, to slaughter the last of the over 100 Dapchi girl, appealed to the President to do everything within his powers to set her free Leah’s father, Nathan Sharibu, as well as her mother, Rebecca, called on the Federal Government to help secure her release by meeting the insurgents’ demands. This was followed by calls by the Christian Association of Nigeria CAN for “stoppage of all political activities until Leah was safely rescued Several well meaning Nigerians had also appealed to the government to do every thing within its powers to ensure the release of Leah Sharibu and all those still being held captive by the Boko Haram insurgents In Abuja, the President of CAN Samson Ayokunle, represented by former Aso Villa Chaplain, Williams Okoye, declared that “ it was inexcusable that eight months after Leah Sharibu’s abduction, government had not been able to secure her release. Another faith-based NGO, Catalyst for Global Peace and Justice, CPJ, which also joined CAN in making the appeal, called on the “Federal Government to suspend political activities in the country until the abducted Dapchi schoolgirl, Leah Sharibu, and over 100 Chibok girls still in Boko Haram captivity regained their freedom”  Tony Ailemen, Abuja
