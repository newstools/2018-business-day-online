The Ondo State House of Assembly has announced the dissolution of the local government chairmen and councillors across the eighteen council areas in the state. While moving the motion for the dissolution on Thursday at the plenary,the Deputy Majority Leader of the House, Oluwasegun Ajimotokin from Irele constituency noted that the tenure of the caretaker committees earlier extended elapsed on Wednesday 17th October 2018. He noted that the dissolution became necessary since there was no communication from the governor. Ajimotokin said, “The House at its parliamentary meeting has adequately debated the tenure of Local Government and resolved that they be dissolved. I hereby move a motion for the disolution of the Committees across the eighteen Local Government Areas of Ondo state with immediate effect.” His motion was seconded by the parliamentary Secretary, Jamiu Maito representing Akoko South-West Constituency 1. The Speaker of the House, Bamidele Oleyelogun subjected the position of the House into a voice vote and it was unanimously agreed that the eighteen Caretaker committees should be dissolved. The Speaker directed the eighteen local Government Caretaker committees to handover management of their respective council areay to the Directors of Local Government Administration with immediate effect. It will be recalled that Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu had in April 2017 constituted the caretaker committees for the council areas following the sacking of the elected executives by a state high court. The governor had extended the tenure of the caretaker committees on two different occasions since their constitution in 2017. It was however unclear if the government will go ahead with the local government election in the state scheduled for December 1,2018.  YOMI AYELESO, Akure
