Air Peace said its Lagos-Owerri flight 7252 on Thursday returned to base after its crew observed that there was a change in cabin pressure. According to a statement issued by Chris Iwarah, the  spokes person for Air Peace, “In line with our standard operating procedure, the captain-in-command descended to a level where it would be comfortable for our valued guests, before making a return to base in line with global best practices in the aviation industry. “Upon safely landing in Lagos, our guests on board, who had remained calm, were quickly transferred to an alternate aircraft and flown to Owerri. “We regret the inconvenience and discomfort caused our esteemed guests on board the flight. We wish to assure members of the public that the incident had nothing whatsoever to do with the engines of the aircraft nor was it a life-threatening situation. “The aircraft has since been thoroughly checked and confirmed serviceable. The aircraft went back into operations in less than an hour after going for maintenance checks. “Air Peace is renowned for its quality maintenance reputation and we assure members of the flying public that we will continue to sustain the high standards of our flight operations and professionalism to guarantee the safety of our valued guests and crew,” the statement added.
