All Progressives Congress (APC), National Working Committee, (NWC) has bowed to pressure from Governors elected on the party’s platform to postpone the May 14th national convention indefinitely. The NWC have also altered the earlier released time table for the conduct of ward, local government and state Congresses. According to the the time table, ward congress was slated for May 2, local government congress, May 5 and state congress May 7. However, the new time table released Friday evening and signed by Bolaji Abdullahi, APC National Publicity Secretary revealed that, ward  congress now holds May 5, local government congress takes place May 12 and State congress is May 19. Abdullahi announced that, “the date for the National Convention in June will be announced later”. This development followed the last week meeting between APC Governors and the NWC of the party after which it was said the governors insisted the dates for convention and congresses be altered. Briefing journalists after the meeting, the APC spokesperson, Abdullahi disclosed that following concerns raised by Governors during the meeting, the NWC would review the time table for congresses and even the national convention. Also speaking to journalists, Kano State Governor, Abdullahi Ganduje said the meeting decided that NWC should review the timetable because in the previous timetable, the ward and local government congresses were too close. “We discover that the congresses are designed to hold on working days and normally we use public premises like schools and secretariats for the conduct of the congresses. “Fixing the congresses during working days means that such places cannot be available. We agreed that the congresses should hold over the weekends,” Ganduje explained.
