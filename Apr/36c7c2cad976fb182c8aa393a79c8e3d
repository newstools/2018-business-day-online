The All Progressives Congress, APC has commended Governor Samuel Ortom over his administration’s indelible marks in Benue state particularly in the areas of poverty alleviation, infrastructure, education, agriculture, rural and urban development and economic development. APC gave this commendation in a congratulatory letter to Governor Ortom on the joyous occasion of his 57th birthday signed by the party’s National Publicity Secretary, Bolaji Abdullahi. The letter stated that Ortom’s life progression and achievements are indeed an inspiration to many, because despite an earlier hitch in life which saw him unable to complete secondary school due to financial constraints, he rose from becoming a professional driver to bagging a Masters Degree and Ph.D. “Governor Ortom has over the years proven himself as an astute businessman, politician and administrator who has used his positions –past and present- to advance charitable causes- particularly in medical and capacity-building philanthropy. “As Governor, Ortom’s inspirational leadership and progressive politics has endeared him to the people as a bridge-builder and true servant-leader whose conduct transcend religious, ethnic and political leanings,” Abdullahi noted. The APC family wished Governor Ortom a happy birthday and good health in continuous service to the party and nation.
