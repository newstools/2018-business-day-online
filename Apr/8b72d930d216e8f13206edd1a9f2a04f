The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has warned Nigerians to disregard media reports that the commission is recruiting Ad Hoc staff for the 2019 general elections, stressing that the information is false. This was disclosed in a statement issued by the media arm of the commission made available to BusinessDay, which noted that the spurious information is the handiwork of unscrupulous elements and mischief makers, who wish to hoodwink members of the public for pecuniary gains. “It has come to the notice of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) that some publications have been circulating on Social Media Platforms and some online news sites that INEC will be Recruiting “100,000 Ad Hoc for 2019 General Election”, this information is false. The general public should disregard this information because INEC is not recruiting at the moment. Don’t be swindled,” the statement said. INEC was prompted to denounce the widespread reports of some news publications on some Social Media Media platforms and some online sites to stop further misinformation of the public even as it tasked the public to always cross-check any information from the commission. INEC, which had a successful three – day international conference on the use of technology in elections last week said it will deploy technology to in all processes of the elections, which it said will help to sustain the integrity of the exercise. It however, ruled out electronic voting.  Innocent Odoh, Abuja
