Former Vice President and 2019 Presidential hopeful, Atiku Abubakar, will on Wednesday present a paper on the challenges of the Nigerian economy and the solutions at the Chatham House in London as he prepares to flag off his presidential campaigns. Media aide to Atiku, Paul Ibe, disclosed this to BusinessDay at the weekend, adding that the Turankin Adamawa, will soon inaugurate his media team to commence campaign for the 2019 presidential elections. He stressed that the former vice president has mapped out strategy to unveil the best media outfit for his 2019 elections campaign. According to the aide, Atiku will at the Chatham House have the opportunity to “unveil his plans,analyze the challenges of the Nigerian economy in modern times and find possible solutions to the myriad of crises bedeviling the country.” Atiku according to Ibe will engage the international community to find more enduring ways to end the insecurity ravaging parts of the country. Atiku, a former stalwart of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), recently dumped the party and returned to his former party the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) alleging that the APC has failed to deliver the promises it made to the Nigerian people and has equally plunged the Nigerian economy into all -time low. Atiku had alleged that the APC had derailed from the principles that made him join the party on February 2, 2015saying in a statement that“while other parties have purged themselves of the arbitrariness and unconstitutionality that led to fractionalization, the All Progressives Congress has adopted those same practices and even gone beyond them to institute a regime of a draconian clampdown on all forms of democracy within the party and the government it produced.” Recently the former Vice President was said to have been in consultations with the Nigerian Intervention Movement (NIM) to support his presidential ambition on the platform of the Grand Coalition with over 30 political parties inspired by NIM but the detail of that consultation is still very sketchy. Atiku and others angling to dethrone incumbent President Muhammadu Buhari are said to be a more formidable alliance to ensure President Buhari, who declared his intention to seek election in 2019, to stop the President.
