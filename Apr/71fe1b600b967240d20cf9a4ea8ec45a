The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has dismissed the advice by the All  Progressives Congress (APC) to learn from former Deputy Senate President, Ibrahim Mantu’s claims on how he rigged elections. PDP National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, in a statement on Sunday, said Mantu’s reported claims was personal to him and has nothing to do with the PDP, as the party has never directed any of its members to rig election on its behalf, at any point since its formation. “Mantu spoke about his personal activities and tendencies in the elections where he participated. The PDP has never directed or had any pact with him to rig election on its behalf. Never! “Individuals run their elections on the platform of political parties once they emerge as candidates. In the PDP, candidates are issued with the party’s Code of Conduct containing the basic rules of electioneering engagements. “There is nowhere in this rules of engagement where candidates or party  members are directed to rig elections on behalf of the party. If any member’s conduct transgressed these basic rules of engagement, that individual did not act on behalf of the PDP, and as such the party cannot be vicariously held responsible. “It will therefore be misplaced for anybody, including the APC, to surmise that Senator Mantu, in the said confession of rigging, acted on  behalf of the PDP,” the statement reads. The party wondered why Mantu lost the 2007 senatorial election if indeed he helped the party rig elections. It urged the governing APC to manage its failures in party administration, which it said had grounded the nation’s economy and brought hunger and starvation to the people.  OWEDE AGBAJILEKE, Abuja
