The statement signed by Kola Ologbondiyan, PDP National Publicity Secretary, pointed out that: “The declaration has placed President Buhari among the ranks of aspirants seeking to be the President of the Federal Republic, effective May 29, 2019. “Until he becomes the candidate of the APC, we will not spend precious time on his mere show of interest”. At the APC National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting on Monday, President Buhari had declared his intention to seek reelection in the 2019 presidential election.  OWEDE AGBAJILEKE, Abuja
