Leading a company and creating value depends on many skills that are hard to measure—strategic vision, authenticity, long-term planning.
Investors aren’t the only stakeholders that need tending to; the best-run companies connect effectively with customers, employees, and the communities where they operate.
All that stops at the feet of CEOs, who must be everything their company’s stakeholders want of them.
BusinessDay, will on April 26, 2018 at the Intercontinental Hotels Lagos, honour the Top 25 CEOs who delivered the most value to stakeholders and contributed to the stellar performance recorded by the Nigerian capital market in 2017.
