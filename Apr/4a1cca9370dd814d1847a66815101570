Imo State governorship aspirant on the umbrella of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and a two-term senator who represented Okigwe senatorial zone, Ifeanyi Araraume says that the state governor, Rochas Okorocha has no powers to stop his ambition to be the next governor of the state, saying only God and Imo people can determine his political future. “Governor Ethelbert Anayo Okorocha is not God and all powers belong to God,” Araraume said, adding that the decision of his becoming the next elected governor of the state rests in the hand of God. A document sent to BusinessDay by Araraume’s Special Adviser on Media, Ik Ogbonna, stated that the senator’s ambition, business, life and future rest in the hands of God, and that Araraume being a Christian is still mindful of the role God Almighty plays in the affairs of men and therefore, in all his dealings, he acknowledges the pre-eminence and ultimate authority of God. The statement added that having made public his ambition, Araraume is now concerned about how to assist the party and its structures at all levels while the state governor is on the other hand allegedly hobnobbing with Social Democratic Party (SDP) and dishing out portfolios- himself as senator for Orlu, his in-law as governor, himself again as president in 2023. According to the document, Governor Okorocha was declared winner of his last two elections after failing severally and only after supplementary or rerun elections were conducted. The election that gave him victory in 2015 was with the active support of Araraume. Araraume said his political career would end at God’s appointed time after he must have accomplished all that God has in stock for him in Nigeria, politically.  SABY ELEMBA, Owerri
